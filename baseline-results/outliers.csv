3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1618,agree,"Did a woman claiming to have a third breast play a hoax on us?

Snopes.com came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay $20,000 (£12,190) for an extra breast.

It argued the fact she didn’t have anyone else take the photos was suspicious, and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevil.com was called Alisha Hessler, who was no stranger to the internet.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

A top plastic surgeon, Mr Nilesh Sojitra, also cast doubt over the surgery after claiming no ‘reasonable’ doctor would perform the operation

‘Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would,’ he told Buzzfeed.

‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,1617,disagree,The woman who claimed she had a third breast has been proved a hoax.
Meet the 3-boobed woman,2392,disagree,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
Report: Second American Journalist Beheaded by Islamic State Terrorists,1676,discuss,"ISIS claims in a new video released Tuesday to have executed by beheading Steven Sotloff, the American journalist who was shown in last month's video execution of James Foley. The executioner was apparently the same in both videos. In the video, ISIS threatened Sotloff would be killed unless the U.S. stopped air strikes in Iraq. Last week, the 31-year-old freelancer's mother released a video plea to the group to spare her son. “As a mother, I ask your justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over,” she said."
Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,1345,disagree,"The story went like this: a young Argentinian man named Yair Tawil just turned 13 years old and was adopted by the country’s president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchhner. Why did she do it? It’s simple really. Due to Argentinian folklore, the president was required to adopt the boy in order to prevent him from turning into a werewolf. At least that’s what people believed. From New York Daily News:

According to tradition in the country, the seventh son born to a family turns into a werewolf, a feared “el lobison”.

The creature only shows its true nature on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th birthday, turning the teenager into a demon at midnight during every full moon.

A demon at midnight? Do tell…

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma. (Via)

The problem here is that all of it is bullsh*t. According to The Guardian, it is a nice mixture of folklore and truth that fooled plenty of people and may have had them running for the silver:

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson…

[Somehow], the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

That makes the entire thing infinitely less appealing. I’m disappointed now, and not just because I was ready to go get The Monster Squad together to test out my “nards” theory. Stupid facts, ruining a good story yet again. I bet science will be coming along shortly, via UBER no doubt, to add in an annoying truth to make werewolves even less cool. F*cking science."
Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2368,discuss,"More details are emerging in the death of Joan Rivers, which occurred when the 81-year-old went into cardiac arrest during what was supposed to be a routine throat procedure at the Upper East Side’s Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. According to CNN, the comedian’s personal doctor took a selfie in the operating room while Rivers was under anesthesia, and also performed a biopsy on her vocal cords without her prior consent. Yorkville's medical director Lawrence Cohen, who has since been let go from his post, was the one originally performing the endoscopy on Rivers. It is believed Cohen then stepped aside to let Rivers' personal doctor — who was not authorized to practice at the clinic — perform the unauthorized biopsy that ultimately caused her to go into cardiac arrest. The doctor named in these accusations has yet to be identified."
‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,893,disagree,"Leading invertebrate researcher says ""a hoax is an understatement"" of photograph appearing to show a colossal crustacean basking off the Kent coastline

A fifty-foot crab dwelling somewhere off the English coast is a thing of nightmares.

The shadowy figure of a colossal crustacean, apparently spotted in the murky waters of Whistable, in Kent, dwarfs boats and cars on the pier it lurks besides.

A satellite picture of the so-called crab, aptly dubbed ‘Crabzilla’, has gone viral after first surfacing on Weird Whitstable, a website for the supernatural curated by illustrator Quinton Winter, which deals in “phantoms, mysteries, tall tales, and artefacts”.

The creature is depicted in the coastal town’s harbour, which is a popular spot for children to go crabbing in the summer.

But those suffering from ostraconophobia (that’s fear of shellfish to you and me) needn’t be left gasping for air, because invertebrate expert Paul Clark at the Natural History Museum in London has branded the photo a hoax.

""I had a good giggle about it - it's ridiculous,"" he said, adding that it ""is definitely not real.""

Here's why:

1. The largest crabs in the world are thought to be Japanese spider crabs - also known as Macrocheira kaempferi - which can grow to the size of a small car with an impressive leg span of up to twelve feet. However, these crabs live in deep, cold water around Japan and are a completely different shape.

2. Another huge crab with a more similar shape to the one in the picture is the Tasmanian giant crab, also known as Pseudocarcinus gigas. These are the world's heaviest crabs but they reside in the southern waters of Australia at depths of 20-820 metres.

3. Mr Clark did not think that the crab was a representation of Cancer pagurus, also known as the edible crab, either because of a slightly different shape. And anyway, these tend to only grow to a maximum of 30 centimetres.

4. Instead, he said that the crab looked more to him like a shore crab (Carcinus maenas) - cleverly Photoshopped on to a satellite image. ""A hoax is an understatement. A shore crab gets up to two inches - if you're lucky!"" he said.

5. Internet hoax debunkers have also been on the case, with a user from ThatsNonsense.com pointing out that the the image of the harbour was taken from Bing maps, sans crustacean in the original satellite photograph, of course."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,661,disagree,"You've heard of the third nipple — but what about a third breast?

A Tampa massage therapist, Jasmine Tridevil, underwent surgery to get just that. Tridevil told Orlando radio station Real Radio 104.1 that she spent close to $20,000 on the procedure.

Tridevil told the station that she contacted more than 50 doctors before finding one who would give her the third breast. ""It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she said. The surgeon she found couldn't create a silicone areola, though, so she had one tattooed onto the implant, which is made from silicone and skin tissue from her stomach.

While Tridevil's dream is to star in an MTV reality show, she told the radio station she had the surgery to become ""unattractive to men"" in addition to gaining fame. ""I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

Tridevil also noted that her parents are displeased with the surgery — her mother no longer speaks to her, and her father ""really isn't happy"" but has ""accepted it,"" she said. --Meghan DeMaria

Allegation Bill Cosby sexually molested Raven Symone are just a hoax,2262,agree,"Raven-Symoné took to Instagram to deny rumors that Bill Cosby molested her while she was on The Cosby Show.

The rumor has been gaining steam for a few days now ever since a site called Hip Hop Hangover published a story claiming the actress was drugged and raped by Cosby and had filed charges against him. That site is (according to their own disclaimer) a ""gossip parody and satirical publication and for entertainment purposes only."" I have no idea who in the hell would consider a story about a young girl being drugged and raped ""entertainment"" but there you have the world of the Internet, folks. Snopes debunked this rumor awhile ago, but just in case people still need more proof, Raven-Symoné posted her own response to this on her Instagram page today:

I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!
I'm sorry that she even has to do this. Sites like this are not ""parody"" or ""satire"" sites, OK? They exist strictly to farm clicks by posting fake stories and deliberately manipulate people. (They should never been lumped in the same category as places like The Onion.) They know damn well that they what they're doing, and slapping a ""satire"" label on it shouldn't excuse their vulgarity and cheap ploy for attention.

ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,594,discuss,"The video showing the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven J. Sotloff appears to be authentic, U.S. officials said Wednesday as President Obama said America would not be “intimidated” by Islamic State militants.

“The U.S. intelligence community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,” said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.

Sotloff’s family, through a spokesman, issued a statement suggesting they believed the footage to be authentic as well. “The family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately,” said the spokesman, Barak Barfi.

It was the second such killing carried out by Islamic State militants. Late last month, American journalist James Foley was beheaded in a similar videotaped slaying.

In Estonia, Obama vowed to “destroy” the Islamic State militants and said the United States would “not be intimidated” by the bloodshed.

The Sotloff video, which surfaced online Tuesday, shows a bound and kneeling Sotloff being held at knife-point by a black-clad militant against a desert backdrop similar to the one shown in an earlier video depicting the beheading of Foley.

The gruesome killings and the group’s threat to decapitate other captives put new pressure on the Obama administration at a time when it is weighing how the United States should respond to an al-Qaeda offshoot that is seen as ruthless but that has not carried out plots beyond the region.

The United States has carried out more than 100 airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq over the past month since the group expanded its control of territory there. But the administration has avoided direct U.S. military involvement in Syria aside from a failed attempt to rescue Foley and other captives earlier this year.

The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have developed lists of possible Islamic State targets in Syria. But Obama, who has expressed concerns about being drawn into Syria’s civil war, indicated last week that he had not yet approved new strikes. “We don’t have a strategy yet,” Obama said in a remark that was later derided by Republican lawmakers and critics.

U.S. officials believe that as many as a dozen Americans may be fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and that the group holds at least two other American hostages, both aid workers.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, had written for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and other publications. He was believed to have been taken captive shortly after entering Syria in 2013, and he was shown in the video of Foley that the Islamic State released last month. Sotloff’s mother, Shirley, recently  released a video pleading with the group for her son’s release.

In the video, an unidentified militant denounces the Obama administration, saying, “I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.” He cites recent U.S. airstrikes against the group in Iraq and warns that “just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

The militant speaks with a British accent, raising the possibility that he is the same person who killed Foley, 40. Both hostages wore orange jumpsuits, much like prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Foley and Sotloff may not have been killed at the same time or place. The militant in the Sotloff video appears to refer to U.S. airstrikes at Amerli in Iraq, which began over the weekend. Sotloff also appears to have more hair on his head and face than in the first video.

The latest video, obtained by the Site Intelligence Group, an organization that tracks the online postings of Islamist militant groups, also shows another hostage identified as David Cawthorne Haines. Haines is a British aid worker who was abducted in March 2013 near the Atmeh refu­gee camp adjoining the Turkish border and the Syrian province of Idlib, according to aid workers involved in efforts to secure his release.

In an apparent reference to Britain, Sotloff’s killer warns “governments that enter this evil alliance of America . . . to back off and leave our people alone.” Haines is shown in the same kneeling position and wearing the same type of orange jumpsuit as Sotloff and Foley before him.

Sotloff had traveled into and out of Syria several times before he was abducted after entering the country from Turkey on Aug. 4, 2013, according to a person familiar with the details of his case. The Florida native had covered turmoil in countries including Egypt and Libya, where his reporting served as the basis of a Time magazine reconstruction of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on U.S. compounds in Benghazi.

In the video that surfaced Tuesday, Sotloff stares stone-faced into the camera while delivering a statement apparently scripted by his captors. “I am Steven Joel Sotloff,” he says, adding that he is “paying the price” for the Obama administration’s policies in the Middle East.

The video lasts less than three minutes but appears to have been carefully produced by the terrorist group, which has used online propaganda to position itself as a successor to al-Qaeda and declare itself the leader of a new Islamic caliphate.

The recording opens with footage of Obama’s remarks after Foley’s death, then cuts to video of Sotloff taken from two camera angles. A digital representation of the Islamic State’s black banner flutters in the upper left corner of the frame.

Foley’s killing last month prompted an unusually emotional response from Obama, who interrupted his vacation on Martha’s Vineyard to warn that the United States would be “relentless” against the Islamic State. Obama, who departed Tuesday for a trip to Estonia and Wales, did not publicly respond to Sotloff’s apparent killing.

British Prime Minister David Cameron issued a statement saying that the video, if authentic, depicts “a despicable and barbaric murder” and that the Islamic State fighters “threaten Syrians, Iraqis, Americans and British people alike and make no distinction between Muslims, Christians or any other faith.”

Haines is among several Western hostages believed to be held by the Islamic State, possibly in Raqqah, a Syrian city that serves as the group’s stronghold.

U.S. and British authorities are still seeking to determine the identity of Foley’s killer. His British accent has intensified concerns in Britain and elsewhere in Europe about the large number of European citizens who have flocked to Syria’s civil war over the past four years.

Britain, France and other countries have seen hundreds of citizens depart for Syria, almost all of them carrying passports that would allow them to return to their home countries or travel to other Western nations.

British officials raised the country’s threat level to “severe” last week as the nation’s home secretary warned that terrorist plots were seen as “highly likely” because of the fallout from the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.

ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,1475,discuss,"ISIS terrorists released a video Tuesday that claims to show the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

In the video titled “A second message to America,’’ Sotloff, 31, of Florida can be seen kneeling in orange garb in front of a black-cloaked executioner following news footage of President Obama taking tough about the terror group.

Sotloff says into the camera that he is “paying the price’’ for US intervention in Syria.

“I am Stephen Joel Sotloff, I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now, and why I am appearing before you. And now it is time for my message,’’ he says.

“Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests. So why is it that I am having to pay the price of your interference with my life? Am I not an American citizen?

“You have spent billions of US taxpayers dollars, and we have lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State. So where is the American interest in reigniting this war?

“From what little I know about foreign policy, I remember a time where you couldn’t win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo,’’ Sotloff says.

“Here you are now Obama, nearing the end of your term and having achieved none of the above and deceivingly marching us, the American people into a blazing fire.”

The masked ISIS killer adds in a British accent, “I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.

“Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

It’s unclear if the executioner is the same fiend who beheaded James Wright Foley on video two weeks ago.

As Sotloff then tries to stand, his killer starts to slit his throat.

The camera cuts out, then footage shows what appears to be Sotloff’s severed head placed on his body.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was in the middle of a daily briefing with reporters in DC when news surfaced about the new video, which lasted roughly 3 minutes.

Earnest said authorities were working to confirm its authenticity while adding, “Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff’s family.”

A man answering the phone at a Sotloff family home in Miami told The Post on Tuesday, “I can’t talk right now. I’m sorry,’’ before hanging up.

Sotloff — who freelanced for Time magazine as well as Foriegn Policy and the Christian Science Monitor — was abducted in Syria in August 2013.

He was last seen in the grisly video of Foley’s execution — when the terrorist killers threatened that he would be next.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” Foley’s ISIS killer hissed at the time.

Sotloff’s stricken mother, Shirley, pleaded from mercy from his captors in a heartbreaking video released last week.

“My son Steven is in your hands,” Shirley Sotloff said.

“Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,” she said. “He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.”"
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,2335,discuss,"Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

Third boob likely a hoax,2183,discuss,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

James Foley's mother 'appalled' by U.S. government handling of case,463,disagree,"The White House is vehemently pushing back against a report that it threatened to prosecute the families of two slain American journalists if they ponied up ransom money to ISIS.

The White House ""took every effort"" to rescue both men, McDonough added.

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, the two journalists beheaded by ISIS, claim the Obama administration threatened to prosecute them if they tried to free the men on their own. ISIS had demanded ransom money in exchange for their kidnapped victims, though such payments are illegal as they are considered to be material support for terrorism.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.

According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."

Hewlett Packard ‘planning to split into two’,1536,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard confirmed on Monday that it will split the company into two new corporations, one focused on PCs and printers and the other on its enterprise businesses.

News of the split was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. On Monday, HP disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it would proceed with the plan, which is expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year 2015.

“Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market,” said HP chief executive Meg Whitman said in a press release. “The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan.”

HP’s split arrives less than a week after eBay’s decision to spin-off PayPal into a separate, public company.

TV show tricks chronic catcallers into harassing their own mothers,1716,disagree,"A Peruvian public service announcement making the rounds today captured two men sexually harassing women on the street, only to find out that the victims of their catcalling are their own moms in disguise. Some sites are treating it as if a prankster's hidden camera actually caught a man hollering at his mom's ""tasty panties,"" but if the scene seems totally staged, that's because it was.

The ""Whistling at Your Mom"" ad actually debuted in Peru back in November, on the heels of the viral ""10 Hours Walking as a Woman in New York City"" that made street harassment a worldwide hot topic. The original Spanish-language video has been viewed more than 5 million times. A reuploaded, translated version hit Reddit this week, bringing the PSA to English-speaking audiences.

When the video first debuted, Spanish newspaper El País reported that the whole scene was staged with actors, but the story was ""based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed female relatives by mistake and expressed 'deep shame.'""

According to internet hoax-busting compendium Emergent.info, Peruvian business newspaper Gestion also called the video out as a scripted setup, writing, ""Speaking about the narrative aspect, it is obvious the situations had been staged. We do understand it would be difficult to go with real interactions, but it is also obvious they wanted us to believe they were real, when they're not.""

It's basically a funnier, tamer version of the hoax video from last November that showed men on Hollywood Boulevard trying to take advantage of a ""drunk"" woman. At least the actors knew what they were getting into in this one.

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2183,discuss,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

A picture posted by Jasmine. Photo: FACEBOOK

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

While another commented, “you’re stupid for doing this. There are other ways to become famous.”

According to Buzzfeed, a young woman from Tampa, Fla., has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on “Inside Edition” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But so far at least that part of her story isn't panning out.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, wrote on Facebook: “So I'm flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

But Kimmel is famous for online pranks, including a viral video called ""Worst twerk fail EVER,"" purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident, that turned out to be staged by his show.

HEALTH: Purported third-breast add raises medical, ethical questions

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.

Well, she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another ""Total Recall"" remake.

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1907,disagree,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

Hewlett-Packard will reportedly split into two companies,1552,discuss,"HP is set to cleave itself in two, splitting off its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. According to The Wall Street Journal, an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. ""Sources familiar with the matter"" tell the paper that current CEO Meg Whitman will become chairman of the PC and printer operation, and will remain CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler will become CEO of the personal computing business — he is currently a high-ranking executive in the division.

This is not the first time talk of splitting HP has surfaced. During some of the company's very tumultuous 2011, reports suggested that executives were close to making the very same decision to split off the enterprise division into its own business. After the departure of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, the company decided to keep the units together under the same corporate umbrella.

The company, based in Palo Alto, has struggled along with the rest of the PC industry as profit margins have slimmed and sales of Windows PC continue to steadily decline. The company's printer business is more lucrative than its PC operation, though the two were combined into the same unit back in 2012. That same year, HP lost the title of top-selling PC manufacturer to Lenovo."

‘Crabzilla’ a 50-foot colossal conundrum,2380,discuss,"The seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer.

He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax

'It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

'Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.'

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

He also said a dozen doctors have been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an alternative acronym for the group.

He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mladenov said.

Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq, 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January, he visited Washington to urge the U.S. to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar.

""Vice President Biden and Gen. [John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,"" Aburisha told CBS News' Jennifer Janisch.

"""When We Felt Threatened, We Opened Umbrellas and Raised Our Hands""",2179,discuss,"If you're an American and you've been watching the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong closely, you may have noticed something familiar: a number of the young demonstrators are using the same ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that became a symbol of last month's protests in faraway Ferguson, Missouri.


Hong Kong's protesters have good reason to put their hands up: police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations, which are rallying against the Chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in 2017. While injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far, the clashes have been bad enough that Hong Kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently, and that anxiety is showing in these photos.


It's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson, or borrowing something they'd seen on the news for their own purposes, or using it coincidentally. But Hong Kongers, particularly young Hong Kongers, pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is well within the realm of possibility that they followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use. Some of the protesters are organized within a group called Occupy Central, named for Hong Kong's Central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with Occupy Wall Street.


It's fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there."
‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2292,disagree,"A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

Meet the 3-boobed woman,561,discuss,"Tampa, Fla. (CBS TAMPA) – A Tampa massage therapist who calls herself “Jasmine Tridevil” says she spent $20,000 on a procedure to add a third breast to her chest.
The Florida woman told a Florida radio station that she “called like 50 or 60 doctors” in order to have the surgery adding a third breast. The 21-year-old says she saved up for two years for the surgery that she hopes will land her a reality television show on MTV. Tridevil says it’s not just fame and fortune that pushed her to have the surgery – it was also a desire to rebuff men
“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she told Real Radio. “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore… Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”
“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”
Last month, she uploaded a YouTube video of herself modeling in a bikini as Radiohead’s “Creep” plays in the background.
Her “Jasmine Tridevil” social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram have received reactions of disbelief – and support — at her selfie photographs featuring her in bikinis and other outfits displaying her third breast. She said she made many of her own outfits for herself.
Tridevil received the surgery a few months prior, although “it was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.
Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.
Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.
“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

This Is The Most Passive-Aggressive Office Battle We've Ever Seen,1204,disagree,"The anonymous note between office colleagues was posted on Facebook

It was shared from a New Zealand radio station and went viral

It is a hilarious note war between the colleagues over a stolen sandwich

The notes were posted on a fridge door in an office kitchen

A frustrated office worker's request to a colleague to stop pinching their lunch from the fridge has sparked a hilarious note war between the two.

The A4 notes pinned to the fridge door of an office kitchen have gone viral on a New Zealand radio Facebook page due to the hilarious content contained on them.

What starts as a simple request to the 'turkey and Swiss on Rye' owner to the 'sandwich thief' to stop stealing their lunch, soon turns into an anonymous office stand-off with several demands being traded.

The passive-aggressive note which started the war between the two office workers

The first demand from the anonymous thief, which infuriates the sandwich thief even further

A return threat from the owner of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' that they will bring HR in to conversation

'To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (Turkey and Swiss with mayo on Rye)...' the first of many passive-aggressive notes reads.

'Stop stealing other people's property!!!'

What follows is one of several demands from the thief to pay $10 and leave it in the fridge in return for the person's lunch - or they'll 'never see it undigested again.'

The thief, a man, includes a picture of him holding a portion of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' - one of many he posts picture with him holding it to prove he has it in his possession.

Refusing to take the sandwich owner's advice to be a 'responsible adult' seriously, he further infuriates 'Turkey and Swiss on rye' who threatens the thief with human resources action.

The conversation loses its professionalism along the way and becomes increasingly personal, before 'Tina from HR' wades in with a note to the sandwich owner.

'Please return the sandwich to the owner and we won't investigate this any further,' Tina writes.

To which the thief replies: 'Buy me a pizza.'

Tina responds: 'No'

The image of the sandwich thief threatening to continue devouring the person's lunch if they don't put $10 in the fridge

The defeated sandwich owner asks...

More evidence that the man is in possession of the sandwich

The owner follows through on his threat to contact HR and a letter from Tina appears on the fridge door

The thief takes his demands to the top

Who would have thought? Tina refuses

The three-way dialogue continues until the thief posts a lengthy note with an image of an empty plate proving that he has devoured the sandwich in full.

It is at this point the alleged thief, 'Francis', is finally found out when Tina traces the printed A4 sheets back to his account.

'Francis we checked the office printer queue and traced the requests back to your desk. Could you please see me at your earliest convenience.'

The hilarious note war winds up with Francis grovelling for his job with a simple one-line request pleading not to be fired.

'Please don't fire me.'

The thief rubs it in even more

The sandwich owner cracks with their first personal spray at the thief

The thief devours the sandwich and posts the finished meal

Caught out: Francis's cover is blown

In fine print the thief grovels to Tina not to fire him"
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,889,agree,"Tampa, Florida -- Jasmine Tridevil had made international headlines by posting pictures and videos claiming she got a third breast implanted into the center of her chest.

The Tampa massage therapist even spoke with 10 News reporter Charles Billi and said it was legit.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" she said.

And indeed, from the outset many were very suspicious of the authenticity of Tridevil's claims. Snopes.com, the urban legends website, took an in-depth look at her story and concluded the facts decisively pointed to a hoax.

And now perhaps the final piece of evidence: 10 News has received an an incident report from Tampa International Airport, where earlier this month Tridevil (real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler) reported her baggage had been stolen.

The luggage was eventually recovered and two people were arrested for stealing several bags off of the airport conveyor belts. When Tridevil went to retrieve her recovered items, a property receipt was written that listed the contents contained within:

Watch Two Guys Appear to Get Tricked Into Catcalling Their Own Moms,994,discuss,"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima."
‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,2026,agree,"After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,2382,agree,"The world's werewolf population likely will have one less member to add to its rolls, thanks to the benevolence of Argentine President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner.

The happy family:

Argentina passed the law because the belief in the curse became so widespread that families were abandoning, putting up for adoption and in some cases killing their seventh sons, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Tawil's parents wrote Fernandez a letter asking her to take on Tawil as her godson, to which she agreed in a ceremony she described to her Twitter followers as ""magical.""

A Florida cat written off for dead after being hit by a car stunned its owner by digging its way out of his grave so he could be fed, it's claimed.

Ellis Huston thought he'd said his final goodbyes to beloved kittie Bart when he buried him in his Tampa backyard shortly after he was knocked down by a vehicle, according to FOX 13.

But he was left flabbergasted when, several days later, the injured but very alive mog wound up outside his home.

The gutsy pet had severe trauma to his head, a broken jaw and a dead eye. But he still begged for food.

Bart was rushed to the vets, where medics said he would likely lose an eye but would hopefully survive.

Huston said he was startled by the feline's apparent return from the dead.

Rescuers at the Tampa Bay Humane Society, where he is currently being treated, believed he may have regained consciousness shortly after being buried, reports FOX 13.

They think he clawed his way out of the ground before hiding for several days before mustering up the courage to go home.

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,1861,agree,"Dr Gwen Korovin was inside Yorkville Endoscopy clinic when the star died

Is alleged to have taken a selfie with her before she went into cardiac arrest

Statement by her attorneys says she's 'respected and admired by peers'

56-year-old ENT was not supposed to be in the room during the procedure

'Lies': Dr Gwen Korovin insists reports she took a selfie with Joan Rivers before she went into cardiac arrest are not true

Joan Rivers' personal doctor has said reports she took a selfie with the star before the procedure that allegedly killed the comedienne are 'lies'.

Dr Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the room at the time of the fatal treatment - has also released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident.

Reports suggest the 'throat specialist to the stars' took a photo of the 81-year-old inside Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 before the star stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords.

However sources close to the ENT have accused CNN - who originally published the story - of 'making up lies'.

According to TMZ she has also denied performing a biopsy on Joan. However it is unknown whether she performed any other procedure while in the room.

Attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman acting on behalf of the medical professional released a statement today, saying she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident.

It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains priveleges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr Korovin does not publicly discus her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

'For these reasons, neither Dr Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press pleases respect Dr Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients as well as the privacy of her patients.'

The doctor who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan.

Joan arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. She died on September 4.

The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords.

The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist who is reported to be Dr Korovin.

It has been reported that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest.

The comedienne was then rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic.

However, she never regained consciousness and died days later after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects.

Dr Korovin has been earmarked as one of the top specialists in the country and is the choice of many celebrities. She has even been involved in a documentary with Celine Dion.

Brit teenage jihadi killed in Syrian airstrike as Britain set to enter war,2279,discuss,British jihadist al-Britani was reportedly killed in a US air strike on Syria.
Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,2270,agree,"After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil, 21, of Tampa had allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself ""unattractive to men,"" we've heard whispers in the wind (and read stories) that this Third Boob is a stunt, a hoax. It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...

Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as ""FALSE,"" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page, Tridevil's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body.

Trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night, where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another, longer look, Tridevil declined, telling the reporter, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Yes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.

Last year, Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading ""I BEAT WOMEN, HONK IF I'M A SCUMBAG"" in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident, but she apparently refused all the calls.

And in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.

Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:

This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.

And Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, ""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.""

So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the ""truth."" But the truth is, we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.

"ISIS Might Be Harvesting Organs To Finance Operations, Iraqi Envoy Tells UN",2151,discuss,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.

According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."
"Beast-eater, frightened phone signal, threw the victim and rend in the taiga",2493,disagree,"A Russian man was recently able to fend off a bear attack with a Justin Bieber song.

Forty-two year old Igor Vorozhbitsyn was recently fishing in Russia's Yakutia Republic when he was attacked by a bear.

During the ordeal Vorozhbitsyn's phone -- which has Bieber's ""Baby"" as the ringtone -- went off, causing the startled bear to run away.

While some might argue the pop song has the ability to repel animals, wildlife experts say the bears might not have anything against Justin Bieber, per se.

The volume of the ringtone is probably what stopped the attack.

One expert told Central European News that an unexpected noise, like a ringtone, can stop an angry bear in its tracks."

ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,2063,discuss,"An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist being held hostage by the militants.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed.

After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.

The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions.

Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.

""I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports,"" he said.

""If there is a video that's been released, it's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity."""
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1960,discuss,The woman who claims she added a third breast provides photos to prove it.
Third boob likely a hoax,2392,agree,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
James Foley's mother 'appalled' by U.S. government handling of case,2195,disagree,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is denying claims that the administration threatened legal action against the families of kidnapped Americans if they paid ransom to their captors, the Islamic State.

McDonough hit a series of Sunday interview shows to promote the administration's counterterrorism plan against the Islamic State, including a plea to Congress to fund anti-Islamic State forces in Syria.

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff — American journalists beheaded by the Islamic State — said the government objected when they considered ransom payments, and even threatened prosecution.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. ""That's our responsibility, to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Ransom payments are prohibited under U.S. law, on the theory they would encourage terrorist groups to kidnap more Americans.

McDonough said he sympathized with the Foley and Sotloff families, and noted that the administration attempted a hostage rescue in Syria.

""We took every effort — and will continue to take every effort — to secure people,"" he said.

In discussing the counter-terrorism plan, McDonough urged Congress to fund anti-Islamic State fighters in Syria, and said the U.S. is ""obviously"" at war with the militant group.

The interviews aired a day after the Islamic State beheaded a third hostage, British aid worker David Haines

The plan that Obama announced Wednesday includes the prospect of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, while expanding ongoing strikes in neighboring Iraq.

Obama, McDonough, and other aides say the plan features assistance to local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS.

In his round of interviews, McDonough echoed Obama's pledge to avoid using U.S. combat troops, and to rely on forces in Syria and Iraq.

""That's why the Syrian opposition is so important,"" McDonough said on CNN's State of the Union, later adding that ""it's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL.""

On ABC's This Week, McDonough said that ""what we want to make sure happens is that we have committed partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. And they will have not only support from us from the air, but they'll also have training and equipment support from us.""

Lawmakers and analysts have questioned Obama's plan, saying that the United States will have to get more involved — including the prospect of ground troops — if the Islamic State is to be defeated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration is ""delusional"" about its plan.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said. ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion ... It's about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army — they're intending to come here.""

Graham also said of Obama: ""This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home.""

Administration officials have offered different descriptions of the administrations's plan, ranging from ""counter-terrorism operations"" to outright ""war.""

On NBC's Meet The Press, McDonough said that ""as much as we've been at war with al Qaeda since we got here, we're at war with ISIL.""

It is ""a complicated effort,"" McDonough said, and ""success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States — an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq, or otherwise.""

Secretary of State John Kerry, who has disputed the use of the term ""war,"" told CBS' Face The Nation that ""there's frankly a kind of tortured debate going on about terminology ... What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL."""
Third boob likely a hoax,661,disagree,"You've heard of the third nipple — but what about a third breast?

A Tampa massage therapist, Jasmine Tridevil, underwent surgery to get just that. Tridevil told Orlando radio station Real Radio 104.1 that she spent close to $20,000 on the procedure.

Tridevil told the station that she contacted more than 50 doctors before finding one who would give her the third breast. ""It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she said. The surgeon she found couldn't create a silicone areola, though, so she had one tattooed onto the implant, which is made from silicone and skin tissue from her stomach.

While Tridevil's dream is to star in an MTV reality show, she told the radio station she had the surgery to become ""unattractive to men"" in addition to gaining fame. ""I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

Tridevil also noted that her parents are displeased with the surgery — her mother no longer speaks to her, and her father ""really isn't happy"" but has ""accepted it,"" she said. --Meghan DeMaria

Mojang does not exist to make as much money as possible for the owners. As the majority shareholder, I'd know.

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,1618,agree,"Did a woman claiming to have a third breast play a hoax on us?

Snopes.com came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay $20,000 (£12,190) for an extra breast.

It argued the fact she didn’t have anyone else take the photos was suspicious, and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevil.com was called Alisha Hessler, who was no stranger to the internet.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

Blood money: How ISIS is selling human organs harvested from living hostages and its own dead soldiers to fund terror across the Middle East,2350,discuss,"UNITED NATIONS (CBS News/CBSDC/AP) — Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.
Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.
“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” he said. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.”
He also said a dozen doctors have been “executed” in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.
Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of “crimes of genocide” in targeting certain ethnic groups.
The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.
Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that “it’s very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.” He used an alternative acronym for the group.
He said Iraq’s most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.
“Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,” Mladenov said.
Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq, 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January, he visited Washington to urge the U.S. to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar.
“Vice President Biden and Gen. [John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,” Aburisha told CBS News’ Jennifer Janisch. “We have received promises and we hope that these promises will materialize in reality on the ground.”

Meet the 3-boobed woman,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

"A Peruvian TV show is tricking men into catcalling their mothers, for feminism",1716,disagree,"A Peruvian public service announcement making the rounds today captured two men sexually harassing women on the street, only to find out that the victims of their catcalling are their own moms in disguise. Some sites are treating it as if a prankster's hidden camera actually caught a man hollering at his mom's ""tasty panties,"" but if the scene seems totally staged, that's because it was.

The ""Whistling at Your Mom"" ad actually debuted in Peru back in November, on the heels of the viral ""10 Hours Walking as a Woman in New York City"" that made street harassment a worldwide hot topic. The original Spanish-language video has been viewed more than 5 million times. A reuploaded, translated version hit Reddit this week, bringing the PSA to English-speaking audiences.

When the video first debuted, Spanish newspaper El País reported that the whole scene was staged with actors, but the story was ""based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed female relatives by mistake and expressed 'deep shame.'""

According to internet hoax-busting compendium Emergent.info, Peruvian business newspaper Gestion also called the video out as a scripted setup, writing, ""Speaking about the narrative aspect, it is obvious the situations had been staged. We do understand it would be difficult to go with real interactions, but it is also obvious they wanted us to believe they were real, when they're not.""

It's basically a funnier, tamer version of the hoax video from last November that showed men on Hollywood Boulevard trying to take advantage of a ""drunk"" woman. At least the actors knew what they were getting into in this one.

The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,1617,agree,The woman who claimed she had a third breast has been proved a hoax.
"Three-Boobed Girl probably a hoax, because obviously",2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,2291,discuss,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

There is no way to confirm if Tridevil’s breast implant is real but she has been gaining thousands of Facebook and Twitter fans since the story broke Monday morning. So: mission accomplished, either way."
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,2425,disagree,"Jasmine Tridevil, 21, spent $20,000 for the plastic surgery, she told an Orlando radio station. 'To me it just feels like another boob,' she says. 'The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.'

One of these things is not like the others.

A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself ""unatttractive to men.""

The admittedly ""crazy"" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore.

""Well I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show last week. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Her parents, though, apparently did not take the news in stride.

""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door.""

Argentina president adopts Jewish godson for first time in country's history,1421,agree,"The tradition to stop stigma about the 'lobison' has continued for a century

The President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.

Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.

Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.

She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a “magical moment”.

Calling the Tawils a “marvellous family” she described Yair as “a total sweety” and dubbed his mother “Queen Esther.”

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers.

Pictures showed them lighting Hanukkah candles together on a menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family."
Florida woman gets third breast surgically implanted,661,agree,"You've heard of the third nipple — but what about a third breast?

A Tampa massage therapist, Jasmine Tridevil, underwent surgery to get just that. Tridevil told Orlando radio station Real Radio 104.1 that she spent close to $20,000 on the procedure.

Tridevil told the station that she contacted more than 50 doctors before finding one who would give her the third breast. ""It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she said. The surgeon she found couldn't create a silicone areola, though, so she had one tattooed onto the implant, which is made from silicone and skin tissue from her stomach.

While Tridevil's dream is to star in an MTV reality show, she told the radio station she had the surgery to become ""unattractive to men"" in addition to gaining fame. ""I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

Tridevil also noted that her parents are displeased with the surgery — her mother no longer speaks to her, and her father ""really isn't happy"" but has ""accepted it,"" she said. --Meghan DeMaria

Woman with three breasts: Real or hoax?,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,2335,discuss,"Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

""I saw it coming.""

ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,2063,discuss,"An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist being held hostage by the militants.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed.

After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.

The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions.

Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.

""I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports,"" he said.

""If there is a video that's been released, it's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity."""
When Photos Lead a Protest,1872,discuss,"From a reader in Hong Kong:

I was at the uneventful (if tense) Legco [Legislative Council] demonstration on Saturday as well as last night's demonstrations between Causeway Bay and Central.

It was as much depressing as, ultimately, uplifting. When I was incapacitated by a blast of pepper spray, I somehow found myself being reverse crowd-surfed to a safe area.

There, a young girl cradled my head and poured water into my eyes. Some others wiped the chemicals off my arms and legs. When they went on to help the next injured person, an old woman kept watch over me, speaking soft Cantonese and plying me with all manner of snacks and drinks. These were complete strangers. Later, when we scrambled to avoid the first tear gas attack, a small band of people committed to staying put and helping the crush of smoke victims climb over the concrete barriers and into safety.
When we felt threatened, we opened umbrellas and raised our hands.

When the police decided to retake the street, they sprayed chemicals in our faces, pointed rifles at us, smashed our limbs with batons. While they were throwing tear gas with reckless abandon, our side threw not one rock, not one bottle, not one egg, nothing. None from our side brandished a firearm, a knife, a club, anything at all. I have neither seen nor heard any reports of protesters looting, burning cars, destroying property, or intentionally injuring police.

Young women felt safe enough to doze off during the lulls. In what other city would tens of thousands of 'rioters' act with such restraint?

The government warned against the chaos Occupy Central would cause. It's all too clear to me which side is supplying the chaos and which side is conducting itself with dignity. These demonstrations may have been sparked by anger, but they're sustained by compassion and love.
I have been working around the clock on a non-China-related magazine project (as the time of this post indicates) and will wait until tomorrow to say something more about the consequential events underway in Hong Kong.

It is of course interesting to note the spread of the ""hands-up/ don't shoot!"" gesture from Ferguson to Hong Kong, but the circumstances in the two places have 100 times more differences than similarities. There are profound differences as well with the other obvious comparison for mass movements among Chinese people, namely the movements throughout China in the summer of 1989.

What is happening in Hong Kong is uplifting, for reasons this reader explains—and surprising, for anyone who knows the generally non-politicized nature of Hong Kong.

But it is also quite a sobering time, as soon as you think about the options open to the PRC government in Beijing, and the instincts it has displayed in the face of all recent challenges of this sort. Beyond question, this is a challenge that the still-relatively new government of ""Mr. 11,"" Xi Jinping, has brought upon himself. That doesn't mean that it will end nicely.

More tomorrow, and overnight good wishes to those driven to such unexpected expressions in Hong Kong."
Woman Who Claimed To Have Surgery To Add Third Breast Exposed As Hoaxer,764,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

Consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Nilesh Sojitra told BuzzFeed News:

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery.

UK looking into reports IS beheading suspect wounded,1324,discuss,"The masked terrorist — suspected of carrying out beheadings Western prisoners, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff — was injured in a bombing raid on Nov. 8, the Mail Online reported Saturday.

The bloodthirsty Islamic State executioner dubbed “Jihadi John” is said to have been wounded by U.S.-led air strike on the Iraqi-Syrian border, according to a report.

The masked terrorist — suspected of carrying out beheadings Western prisoners, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff — was injured in a bombing raid on Nov. 8, the Mail Online reported Saturday.

The Mail cited an unnamed nurse saying “Jihadi John” was among several Islamic State leaders wounded in the air strike in the western Iraqi town of Al Qaim.

The cold-blooded killer was among a group of high-level ISIS leaders meeting in an underground bunker targeted by U.S. and Iraqi bomber jets, Mail reported.

“Jihadi John,” who spoke with a British accent in the ISIS-released snuff videos, was said to have narrowly escaped with his life. He and others were treated at the Al Qaim General Hospital and then driven to Syria, a nurse told the Mail.

The nurse, among the emergency team that treated the wounded terrorists, also said that top ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was also wounded in the strike.

Earlier reports of Al-Baghadadi being killed or severely wounded in the air strike have been debunked. An audio tape emerged Thursday of Al-Baghdadi mentioning developments that have occurred since the Al Qaim air strike and imploring his followers to keep fighting “even if only one soldier remains.”

In a statement Saturday, the British Foreign Office could neither confirm nor deny the reports.

“We are aware of the reports,” the Foreign Office statement reads. “We cannot confirm these reports.”

"3 Reasons Kim Jong-un Could Be Missing, Including A So-Called Downfall By Cheese",2193,discuss,"His gorging has seen him put on so much weight that the tubby tyrant now walks with a limp.

The addicted 31-year-old constantly stuffs his face with the holey Swiss scoff after falling in love with Emmental while he was a student in Switzerland.

A Korean source said: “His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power.”

This has prompted terrified enemies of the regime who have fled North Korea to claim his poor health is down to his expanding waistline.

Kim was spotted limping at a ceremony in the North Korean capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder, his granddad KimIl-sung.

His face looked swollen and he was limping on his right leg, wearing a gloomy expression through the parade.

And Emmental, which is 45% fat, is said to be sending plump Kim to an early grave.

The despot – who rules a country where millions are starving – ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese making because he was furious at the quality of dairy products in the Asian state.

Third boob likely a hoax,785,agree,"She made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as Tampa Bay’s 10 News revealed Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three-breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on Sept. 16.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prosthesis.”

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumor site Snopes also discovered that her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone to whom Tridevil bears a striking resemblance.

However, when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be skeptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Photo: FaceookTridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 to 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for.”

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn agreed that while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely that anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip, Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple,” which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” on her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different … that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre-surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

It’s not the first time Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after he made unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges, she offered her attacker an ultimatum, telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women.’”

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,1907,disagree,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

Some sites are claiming it’s from a Peruvian TV show, but it’s not.

It’s actually a mockumentary by the sports brand Everlast and this campaign to stop street harassment.

As such, it’s staged, but anyway – the video purports to show how some men who whistle and make sexist comments on the streets were tricked by a film team.

The team played out dressing the abusers’ mothers differently and disguising them…

…waiting for the men to start catcalling…

….and then giving them hell.

Now, it didn’t actually happen. That said, El País actually claimed that the campaign is based on interviews with men who accidentally harassed female relatives by mistake. And the message seems to be getting through. The original has had over 5 million views.

The campaign also features Natalia Málaga, a celebrated volleyball player and coach.

Blood money: How ISIS is selling human organs harvested from living hostages and its own dead soldiers to fund terror across the Middle East,1842,discuss,"UNITED NATIONS – Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

He also said a dozen doctors have been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an acronym for the group.

He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mladenov said."
Meet the 3-boobed woman,1092,disagree,"Though we had serious suspicions, we wanted to believe so badly that the story of Jasmine Tridevil, the Tampa woman who claimed to have gotten a third boob implanted in order to appear unattractive to men, was real. But now, a final piece of evidence confirms the whole thing was a hoax.

WTSP has uncovered a stolen luggage report from the Tampa International Airport that lists a ""3 breast prosthesis"" as part of the baggage. The report was filed by Alisha Hessler, a Tampa-area massage therapist, whom Snopes fingered as the evil genius behind the Tridevil persona.

This is Hessler's second run-in with viral fame: Back in December 2013, she made a man wear a dunce cap and a sign that says ""I beat women"" on a busy street corner after he reportedly beat her up. Hessler never followed up with police following the incident.

Sorry, dudes: It appears your Total Recall sex fantasies have been temporarily sidelined."
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,252,agree,"We all had our suspicions about the three-boob lady's third boob, and now it appears that the worst is true: Jasmine Tridevil's third breast, TMZ reports, is not a true implant, but a mere prosthetic.
The hot boob scoop came from a police report filed in connection with Tridevil (real name Alisha Hessler) at the Tampa International Airport. According to the report, Hessler/Tridevil's bag was stolen from a luggage conveyor and eventually recovered. Listed among the bag's contents, alongside a hairbrush, clothing, and stiletto heels: a ""3 breast prosthesis.""

Previously, the myth-busting site Snopes collected evidence about Hessler's apparent history as an internet hoaxster, including a story that Gawker picked up last year. The dream is over. You were too beautiful for this world, boob."
The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,2291,discuss,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

Crabzilla,1546,discuss,"The crabs human see or eat are usually only six or so inches across their shells. An aerial image taken in the UK captured a massive crab, and is now garnering a lot of attention online.

Quinton Winter, who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual, is one of the folks who has seen the picture. Initially, he believed he was looking at a bizarre sand formation that bore a striking resemblance to a crab. However, he now thinks it is indeed a real-life crab -- one that he actually saw in person last summer. Winter explained, 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'That's a funny looking bit of driftwood.' It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.'

"Three-Boobed Girl probably a hoax, because obviously",2486,agree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

These Men Weren't Really Tricked Into Sexually Harassing Their Moms,1910,agree,"One tactic that should prevent overly hormonal street-bros from catcalling women is imagining what their own mothers would think of this behavior. In a new Peruvian ad, however, that threat becomes an all-too-real Freudian nightmare.


Athletics brand Everlast recently teamed up with activist group Paremos el Acoso Callejero (Stop Street Harassment) to teach catcallers on the streets of Lima what their mothers apparently never taught them--by using the people in the world most suited for that very task. In the viral video, which is clearly staged, although it's fun to pretend that it isn't, the Paremos team gets hold of the mothers of area serial harassers and recruits them for a guerrilla mission to end their sons' lives.


These women disguise themselves with dresses, wigs and a copious amount of makeup to go undercover as catcall-bait--and it works to a degree that will alternately delight and horrify. It's probably the funniest possible way to call attention to the fact that 7 out of 10 women on the streets of Peru are sexually assaulted. This dumb video may not be real, but the problem is, and it's a good way to remind potential catcallers of the inherent grossness of their actions."

Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,1741,discuss,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1490,agree,"Jasmine Tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob, but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff. Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible, it is not plausible.

""[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” Dr. Matthew Schulman, a board-certified plastic surgeon in New York, told the Daily Dot. “I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.""

There are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevil’s story. The first is the photographic “evidence” of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered, the Daily Dot wrote.

Second, creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required.

When asked about her surgery, Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She didn’t mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery.

The final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevil’s third breast is fake was the final result. “This technique would create a tight, round breast in the center of the chest,” he said. “Also, all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft, pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast, and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure.”

During a radio interview, Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a “striking” resemblance to Alisha Hessler, the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVIL.com is registered.

Hessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her, Snopes wrote. She reportedly made a man hold a sign that said “I beat women.” She withdrew her complaint with the police department after she was asked for details about the alleged attack, Buzzfeed wrote.

Tridevil said on her Facebook account Tuesday Alisha Hessler is her real name. She also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone else’s identification to get into a club. “I was underage and wanted to get drunk lol,” she wrote.

She told The Sun her claim is not a hoax and her film crew recorded her procedure. She said she will release the footage when she gets a reality television show and “I really don’t care what people say about me.”

HP to split into two businesses -- report,1838,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +2.00%  plans to break in two, separating its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the people said. It is expected to be effected as a tax-free distribution of shares to the company’s stockholders next year, one of the people said.

The move is one H-P and its investors and analysts have long contemplated. It would come amid a wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world, underpinned by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—if not actively sought by them.

On Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

In 2012, under current H-P CEO Meg Whitman, H-P reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation.

Ms. Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the separate, so-called enterprise company, one of the people said. Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business, this person said.

In fiscal 2013, the printing and personal systems group, as it is known, inked $55.9 billion in revenue, about half the Palo Alto, Calif., company’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for the company as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd, according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P, famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto 75 years ago, has been undergoing a multiyear restructuring under Ms. Whitman as the company tries to stem sales declines. Aside from the PC and printer business, the rest of H-P’s revenue comes from selling services and hardware such as servers and data-storage systems to corporations, as well as software and financial services.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since last year, but are still well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached in the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

To combat lower sales and provide lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as cloud software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

H-P has also been contemplating big strategic changes lately. Over much of the past year, the company held talks to merge with data-storage giant EMC Corp., but those negotiations, which would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion, recently ended.

‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,2282,discuss,"IS it Crabzilla or Claws? This aerial image of a giant crab lurking at a British resort has become an internet sensation.

People have been flocking to a website to judge for themselves whether this picture shows a huge crustacean in shallow water at a harbour mouth in Kent or is just an elaborate hoax.

Quinton Winter, who collates strange and spooky sightings for his Weird Whitstable website, at first thought the image sent to him by a follower showed an unusual sand formation in the shape of a crab but is now convinced it’s a true monster of the deep.

**CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE CREATURES IN DIGUISE**

He believes he saw the giant lurking close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer in the harbour at Whitstable, which is famed for its oysters.

He said: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

The picture appears to show an edible crab, scientific name cancer pagurus, a species commonly found in British water but which normally only grows to 10 inches, weighing six pounds.

The biggest known crab species is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
Missing Nuke In Colorado Sparks Intense Russian Fears,1937,disagree,"Despite a wild report on a website dedicated to conspiracy theories, local soldiers haven't lost a low-yield nuclear weapon.

As the lockdown of soldiers in a Fort Carson battalion dragged into its fifth day Monday, the site Whatdoesitmean.com reported that a nuclear artillery shell was missing - an item that hasn't been in the Army inventory for 22 years. That story was translated into several languages, including Russian and spread rapidly on the Internet.

Photo - The modified M9-Beretta pistol used for the Basic Active Shooter Course fires a powder propelled paint cup to provide the most realistic training possible while maintaining the level of safety required for the scenarios, Jan 26.  The course is taught by a 4-man training team from the 610th Security Forces Squadron, Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas.  They came to Dobbins Air Reserve Base to provide this critical training for the 94th Security Forces Squadron and other Dobbins area security personnel.  The two day course provides classroom and tactical instruction to first responders covering several shooting spree scenarios.   (U.S. Air Force photo/ Brad Fallin) + caption

Sources at the post told The Gazette that the lockdown involving 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armor Regiment is actually for something more mundane - a 9 mm pistol. The Army hasn't officially released details on what spurred the lockdown and search, calling it ""missing government property.""

The lockdown started with about 800 soldiers confined to the battalion's buildings on the post. That was reduced over the weekend to about 100 soldiers - a company of troops.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Terrance McWilliams, who served as the post's top enlisted soldier, said lockdowns are a common practice commanders use to turn up lost gear.

""I personally went through it as a 1st sergeant and the longest it took was four days,"" said McWilliams.

The lockdown was triggered Thursday after the pistol turned up missing in an equipment inventory that followed a training exercise. Post officials ordered a wide search for the missing weapon Thursday, including inspecting cars as they exited the post at gates.

Retired Command Sgt. Maj. John Kurak, who also held Fort Carson's top enlisted post, said a five-day lockdown isn't close to a record for Fort Carson.

""In Fort Carson's history there have been lockdowns that have lasted months,"" Kurak said, noting that an infantry battalion on there spent three months on lockdown in the late 1980s after a M-16 rifle was lost.

McWilliams said the first step in the search for the weapon likely was quizzing the soldier who checked it out from the unit's armory for the training exercise. The battalion's soldiers were returning from a training exercise that spanned a wide swath of the 137,000-acre post.

When it was determined that the weapon was lost, soldiers were likely sent to scouring training areas in a move called ""hands across Fort Carson"" that sees soldiers walking shoulder-to-shoulder to find the missing weapon.

When that didn't bear fruit, soldiers were ordered to remain on duty and on post until the weapon was found - a lockdown.

Long lockdowns like the one that deprived 1st Battalion soldiers of what was a planned four-day weekend, do come to an end.

""Eventually its going to get to the point where they determine the item is actually lost,"" McWilliams said. ""Then they will determine what actions to take against the person responsible for the item.""

Losing a weapon can bring stiff consequences in the military, where loss or destruction of government property can be charged as a crime bringing up to a year behind bars.

The Army spends a lot of time keeping track of pistols, rifles and other ""sensitive"" items. Every training day begins and ends with a sensitive items check, and daily inventories are sent up through the chain of command.

""If you can't keep track of your equipment, how can you be expected to do more complex tasks?"" Kurak asked.

In combat, units heading out and returning from stop for a ""boys and toys"" check to make sure all weapons, night vision goggles, laser sights, radios and other items are on hand.

""Accountability of equipment is a basic and essential function of a unit,"" Kurak said.

While the battalion may have lost a pistol, scores of web pages carried the nuclear weapon tale Monday. That story, attributed to unnamed Russian intelligence sources, alleged that a 155 mm artillery-fired nuclear warhead is missing at the post.

The battalion involved, though, doesn't have artillery. And the W-48 artillery warhead alleged to be missing was pulled from Army bases worldwide in 1992.

While the Pikes Peak region is home to a five military bases, it doesn't house nuclear weapons. The closest nuclear arms are atop Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo."

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Her parents, though, apparently did not take the news in stride.

""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door.""

Third boob likely a hoax,1244,agree,"The Tampa, Fla. woman who claimed to have had plastic surgery to add a third breast is fake, according to TMZ.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, was reportedly discovered to have faked the plastic surgery after TMZ obtained a police report filed by Tridevil after her bag was stolen at Tampa International Airport.

TMZ reports that the bag was stolen off of an American Airlines conveyor belt and a ""3 breast prosthesis"" was found inside by police after they recovered the bag.

Buzzfeed initially reported the woman's strange look landed her appearances on ""Inside Edition"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" but FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV."
Woman has surgery to get third breast: The three most statistically unlikely pairs of boobs,2183,discuss,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

While another commented, “you’re stupid for doing this. There are other ways to become famous.”

"Report: HP to split into two companies, one focused on PCs/printers and one on enterprise computing",1838,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +2.00%  plans to break in two, separating its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the people said. It is expected to be effected as a tax-free distribution of shares to the company’s stockholders next year, one of the people said.

The move is one H-P and its investors and analysts have long contemplated. It would come amid a wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world, underpinned by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—if not actively sought by them.

On Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

In 2012, under current H-P CEO Meg Whitman, H-P reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation.

Ms. Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the separate, so-called enterprise company, one of the people said. Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business, this person said.

In fiscal 2013, the printing and personal systems group, as it is known, inked $55.9 billion in revenue, about half the Palo Alto, Calif., company’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for the company as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd, according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P, famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto 75 years ago, has been undergoing a multiyear restructuring under Ms. Whitman as the company tries to stem sales declines. Aside from the PC and printer business, the rest of H-P’s revenue comes from selling services and hardware such as servers and data-storage systems to corporations, as well as software and financial services.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since last year, but are still well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached in the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

To combat lower sales and provide lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as cloud software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

H-P has also been contemplating big strategic changes lately. Over much of the past year, the company held talks to merge with data-storage giant EMC Corp., but those negotiations, which would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion, recently ended.

'I had a third breast implant so I can turn off men',2258,discuss,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

Parents say they were kept in the dark on attempts to save James Foley,2195,discuss,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is denying claims that the administration threatened legal action against the families of kidnapped Americans if they paid ransom to their captors, the Islamic State.

McDonough hit a series of Sunday interview shows to promote the administration's counterterrorism plan against the Islamic State, including a plea to Congress to fund anti-Islamic State forces in Syria.

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff — American journalists beheaded by the Islamic State — said the government objected when they considered ransom payments, and even threatened prosecution.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. ""That's our responsibility, to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Ransom payments are prohibited under U.S. law, on the theory they would encourage terrorist groups to kidnap more Americans.

McDonough said he sympathized with the Foley and Sotloff families, and noted that the administration attempted a hostage rescue in Syria.

""We took every effort — and will continue to take every effort — to secure people,"" he said.

In discussing the counter-terrorism plan, McDonough urged Congress to fund anti-Islamic State fighters in Syria, and said the U.S. is ""obviously"" at war with the militant group.

The interviews aired a day after the Islamic State beheaded a third hostage, British aid worker David Haines

The plan that Obama announced Wednesday includes the prospect of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, while expanding ongoing strikes in neighboring Iraq.

Obama, McDonough, and other aides say the plan features assistance to local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS.

In his round of interviews, McDonough echoed Obama's pledge to avoid using U.S. combat troops, and to rely on forces in Syria and Iraq.

""That's why the Syrian opposition is so important,"" McDonough said on CNN's State of the Union, later adding that ""it's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL.""

On ABC's This Week, McDonough said that ""what we want to make sure happens is that we have committed partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. And they will have not only support from us from the air, but they'll also have training and equipment support from us.""

Lawmakers and analysts have questioned Obama's plan, saying that the United States will have to get more involved — including the prospect of ground troops — if the Islamic State is to be defeated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration is ""delusional"" about its plan.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said. ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion ... It's about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army — they're intending to come here.""

Graham also said of Obama: ""This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home.""

Administration officials have offered different descriptions of the administrations's plan, ranging from ""counter-terrorism operations"" to outright ""war.""

On NBC's Meet The Press, McDonough said that ""as much as we've been at war with al Qaeda since we got here, we're at war with ISIL.""

It is ""a complicated effort,"" McDonough said, and ""success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States — an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq, or otherwise.""

Secretary of State John Kerry, who has disputed the use of the term ""war,"" told CBS' Face The Nation that ""there's frankly a kind of tortured debate going on about terminology ... What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL."""

Hewlett Packard ‘planning to split into two’,1994,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +6.68%  on Monday said it plans to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the latest attempt by the technology company to improve its fortunes by breaking itself in two.

The company will make the split through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders by the end of fiscal 2015.

If the division goes off as planned, it would give rise to two publicly traded companies, each with more than $50 billion in annual revenue.

H-P also boosted the number of its expected layoffs by 5,000 to 55,000, after identifying “incremental opportunities for reductions.” H-P had previously projected its job cuts to be between 45,000 and 50,000, and it has already shed 36,000 employees under the restructuring program as of the end of the most recent quarter.

A number of big companies, including eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  in tech, have chosen to break up lately, in part because of a belief that operations with different growth profiles are best managed as separate entities. H-P, which has suffered sharp sales declines, sees better long-term potential for its corporate hardware and services business than for its printer and PC unit, said one person familiar with the plan.

The impending move, first reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, set off a round of speculation in the industry about whether the separation could lead to more deal making.

The Journal recently reported that for much of the past year, H-P held talks to merge with data-storage equipment maker EMC Corp. EMC +0.49%  , a deal that would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion. Although the talks recently ended, the separation could pave the way for H-P’s corporate hardware and services business to ultimately be combined with EMC, industry observers said.

The planned breakup is one that Palo Alto, Calif.-based H-P and its investors have long contemplated. H-P came close to hiving off its PC operation in 2011, when it announced the ill-fated acquisition of U.K. software company Autonomy Corp. H-P said then it was exploring a separation of its PC business, only to decide two months later to hold on to it amid pressure from shareholders, which led to the departure of then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker.

H-P in 1999 spun off Agilent Technologies, A +1.93%  a maker of electronic-testing gear and other hardware. Agilent subsequently announced plans to break itself up.

In 2012, under current H-P Chief Executive Meg Whitman, the company reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation, helping pave the way for the current plan.

Ms. Whitman is slated to be chairman of the PC and printer business, to be known as HP Inc., and CEO of the other company, to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Current lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business.

H-P, which affirmed its guidance for the year ending Oct. 31, said it expects per-share earnings of $3.83 to $4.03 for fiscal 2015. The range doesn’t include one-time charges expected to be connected to the separation. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting $3.95 a share.

In the 2013 fiscal year ended last October, the Printing and Personal Systems Group, as it is known, reported $55.9 billion in revenue, about half of H-P’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for company revenue as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK +0.68%  , according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since the beginning of last year, but they remain well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached during the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% on Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

In response to lower sales and to provide a lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as “cloud” software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

The recent wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world has been fueled by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—and sometimes actively sought by them.

Last Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay, where Ms. Whitman was once CEO, announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,548,agree,"What did you do this weekend? Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adopted a young boy as her godson so he wouldn't turn into a werewolf and eat babies. Yes, really! (Kind of.)

It's actually part of a long-standing tradition stemming from Argentinian folklore that says the seventh son in families with no girls are doomed to turn into ""el lobison,"" a werewolf who feeds on unbaptized babies and whose bites could turn others into werewolves. Belief in the legend was once reportedly so widespread that families were abandoning their seventh sons, giving them up for adoption, or killing them.

A law was passed in the 1920s to counteract the effect (the law was expanded in 2009 to include girls and non-Catholic children), and now, every year, the president formally adopts a boy or girl as his or her godchild, awarding him or her a medal, ""presidential protection,"" and a scholarship to study until the godchild turns 21.

This year, Fernandez de Kirchner formally adopted Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. In 1993, Yair's parents reportedly wrote to the president asking for the honor and were denied, but this year, Yair wrote to Fernandez de Kirchner himself and got his wish, making him the first Jewish boy in Argentina to be officially adopted by the president.

UN urged to investigate ISIS's bloody trade in human organs after Iraqi ambassador reveals doctors are being executed for not harvesting body parts,2151,agree,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.

Original Article اقرا المقال الأصلي باللغة العربية
According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,2245,agree,"A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent, UK, is proving a great drawcard… for the website that’s claiming it’s a giant crab.

Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UK’s weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it.

But even he couldn’t believe this aerial photograph of a 50-foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour:


Crab, sandbank, or Photoshopping idiot? Picture: Weird Whitstable
So he went to check it out for himself.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’,” Winter said.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

Reports: 3 missing Afghans detained at Canadian border,2312,discuss,"The three Afghanistan National Army officers who disappeared this weekend during a training exercise on Cape Cod have been found trying to cross the border into Canada near Niagara Falls, sources said Monday.

A top Massachusetts law enforcement officials tells NBC News that the three were caught at the famed Rainbow Bridge.

The three arrived 11 days ago with 200 soldiers and civilians from several countries for training at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. They were last seen Saturday at a shopping mall in Hyannis during a day off. Massachusetts State Police, with the help of the FBI and the Guard, had been trying to find them.

Col. Timothy Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, had told NBC News earlier, ""There's no reason to think they have nefarious intent, and no information to suggest that public safety is in question. But there's a pause for concern, because we want to make sure this wasn't planned, and we want to see if anyone has helped them."" He said because the men have visas that remain valid for the next several days, they're in the country legally.

Several officials say the widely held view is that they were trying to find some way to stay in the country. Gov. Deval Patrick today said publicly what many state and local officials say privately — that they're not considered a danger. Their disappearance follows an apparently similar event last week when two policemen from Afghanistan went missing during a DEA training program in the Washington area. They were found in New York. Earlier this month, a senior Afghan military officer slated to carry the flag for his country at a NATO summit in Wales applied for asylum in the United Kingdom upon his arrival."
Transgender Teen Commits Suicide & Pens A Heartbreaking Note Urging The World To Change,2198,agree,"A 17-year-old transgender girl in Ohio committed suicide by walking into traffic early Sunday morning.

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan, left behind a harrowing note posted on Tumblr that exposed the pain, frustration and rejection Leelah felt, including her feeling that “there’s no way out,” and her concern that she would never fully transition.

Leelah died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after she was hit by a tractor trailer near the  South Lebanon exit of I-71. While initial news reports seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids.

Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.

On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

Later, she detailed her emotional turmoil.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy.

Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me.

As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.

I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

Leelah was being home-schooled at the time of her death.

"Woman Gets Third Boob Implanted, Wants to Be ""Unattractive to Men""",2392,disagree,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,1031,discuss,"e Islamic State militant group released a video today purporting to show the beheading of U.S. hostage Steven J. Sotloff.

A masked figure in the video also issued a threat against a British hostage, a man the group named as David Haines, and warned governments to back off ""this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State"", the SITE Intelligence Group monitoring service said.

Sotloff, a freelance journalist, was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. Sotloff's mother Shirley appealed on Aug. 27 in a videotaped message to Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, for her son's release.

The White House said it could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing that if there is such a video, it would be analyzed very carefully, adding that the administration's thoughts and prayers were with Sotloff's family.

Shortly before the briefing, the SITE monitoring service said the militant group had released the video.

On Aug. 19 the group published a video showing the beheading of U.S. hostage James Foley, a Marquette and Northwestern alum. The group said his death was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes on fighters in Iraq.

That video was issued after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq in August for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011.

After Islamic State's beheading of journalist James Foley, President Barack Obama's administration is making little headway in efforts to secure the release of other Americans held by the insurgent group in Syria, officials said.

The U.S. government has said it does not pay ransoms or negotiate with the Islamic State.

Washington has contacted about two dozen countries for help in freeing the three, but no foreign government appears to have influence over or even significant contact with IS, which has declared an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.

""What we've found is that ISIS isn't responsive"" to outreach, said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity and using an alternate acronym for the group.

Another administration official said Washington was working with other Western countries whose citizens are being held hostage, and with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and others in the region thought by the United States to possibly have influence with the groups Al-Nusrah and IS.

The hostages' fate received little public attention until Islamic State posted an online video on Aug. 19 showing Foley's beheading. It now presents a frustrating challenge for Obama.

Islamic State ""is far more difficult to deal with"" than Iran or the militant group Hezbollah, which also took Americans captive, said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official now at the Brookings Institution think-tank. The group ""wants to terrorize Americans, it's not really interested in deals.""

WHITE HOUSE INVOLVEMENT
U.S. officials and supporters of the remaining hostages requested that most details about them and efforts to free them be withheld.

One of the other U.S. hostages is a female aid worker, age 26, for whom Islamic State has demanded $6.6 million in ransom, according to ABC News.

Lisa Monaco, Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser, has been ""very deeply involved in this,"" the senior U.S. official said. Monaco, along with the State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, has been in contact with hostages' families, the official said.

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said, "" The Administration has had regular interactions with the families of those Americans who have been held hostage in Syria since the kidnapping of their loved ones. These interactions included representatives from all the relevant agencies, including the Department of State, the FBI, the Intelligence Community, and the White House.""

Obama authorized a covert raid in Syria in July to rescue Foley and other American hostages, but they were not at the site where they were thought to be held. Another rescue attempt would be risky for U.S. special forces and the hostages.

The American diplomatic effort also is aimed at persuading European countries not to pay ransoms, officials said.


U.S. and European officials have said that France, Spain and Italy have tolerated or facilitated ransom payments for citizens held in Syria. Islamic State released numerous European journalists this year, including two Spaniards in March and four Frenchmen in April.

The French government has denied a news report that it paid a ransom to free the four. Spain's foreign ministry has not commented on the matter.

The U.S. policy of refusing to pay ransoms to discourage further hostage-taking ""is as close as we are likely to come to governments influencing ISIS on the matter of seizing hostages"", said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA analyst now at Georgetown University.

U.S. officials have said that Qatar played a critical role in persuading a rival group in Syria, the official al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, to free American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, whom it had been holding since 2012.

Qatar is working to help free other Americans held captive in Syria, a Gulf source told Reuters, but U.S. officials said the Qatari government has little if any leverage with Islamic State.

Enraged spouse chops off unfaithful husband's manhood – TWICE,1366,discuss,"It was a really awful week to be one Chinese man's penis, according to a fantastical tale of dick butchery making its way around the internet.

Fan Lung, 32, was reportedly caught cheating with a younger woman after he used his wife's phone to send a message to his lover and ineptly forgot to log out afterward. His enraged wife, Feng, lopped off his dick with a pair of scissors, but doctors were able to reattach it after he was rushed to the hospital.

But Feng followed him, snuck into his hospital room while he was recovering from surgery, and cut his dick off again. And then, for good measure, she threw it out the window.

""The two subsequently clashed outside the facility, with a naked and bleeding Fan repeatedly beating his wife, until onlookers called the police,"" according to an AFP story.

The photos above allegedly show that fight.

It was sad, sad fate for Fan Lung's penis, which wasn't recovered, but a happy ending for Fan Lung, who will reportedly marry his mistress anyway.

""It doesn't matter if he turns out to be infertile, he has five children anyway,"" she's quoted as saying.

The legend of the double dismemberment comes from government-owned Chinese news agency HNR, which picked it up from China's hugely popular Twitter-like social network, Sina Weibo.

The story hasn't been entirely debunked, but it's dubious at best. Hoax-tracking site emergent.info points out that the Weibo account credited for the original photos has either been deleted or never existed at all.

But if you're an idealist in a this mad world full of penises that stay stubbornly, boringly attached to their owners, and you want to believe in revenge and true love, go right ahead.

Florida woman gets third breast to become 'unattractive' 32,1924,agree,"A Florida massage therapist said she paid $20,000 for a third breast in hopes of becoming less attractive to men

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,2301,agree,The woman who reported adding a third breast was lying and the story is a hoax.
Meet the 3-boobed woman,2486,disagree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,963,agree,"BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 29 (UPI) -- Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner adopted Jewish boy Yair Tawil as her godson to protect him from the stigma of a folk tale prophesying he will turn into a werewolf.
In Argentina, there is a legend the seventh son born to a family with no daughters will turn into ""el lobison"" or a werewolf upon his 13th birthday. The legend became so feared that families would abandon or kill their sons. To counteract this stigma, the president of Argentina began in 1907 to adopt one of the boys as their godson.

Tawil is the first Jewish godson as the honor only applied to Catholic boys until 2009. His parents asked for the honor in 1993 but were denied. He appealed to Kirchner, citing the 2009 decree and was accepted as the candidate.

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2119,discuss,"The comedienne's doctor reportedly took a selfie with the star before undertaking an unauthorized biopsy, it has been claimed

Joan Rivers' personal doctor took a selfie while the comedian was under anesthesia and the physician was set to perform an unauthorized biopsy, a report has claimed.

The incident allegedly occurred in Manhattan's Yorkville ­Endoscopy shortly before Joan, 81, underwent a procedure on her vocal chords that led to her suffering a cardiac arrest, CNN reports.

Investigators have been informed of the incident by a member of staff at the clinic, according to the broadcaster, which also claims that gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen finished his work on the star shortly before her unidentified personal physician performed the biopsy.

Rex Features   Dr Lawrence Cohen the Yorkville Endoscopy doctor has been fired since Joan Rivers death - he did not carry out reported biopsy

However, just before performing the procedure, it is claimed that the physician took out his camera to take a picture of himself alongside Joan, who was unconscious at the time.

During the subsequent biopsy, Joan suddenly went into cardiac arrest, with investigators believing that her vocal chords began to swell, thereby cutting off oxygen to her lungs.

Earlier this week, a voice recording emerged of Rivers complaining of trouble with her vocal chords.

She can be heard saying: ""I told [you] I didn't feel good. My voice has been bothering me. I don't know what it is . . . I feel like s***. I'm tired already.""

Later, she said: ""That's it - I don't feel good.""

The news comes following reports that the clinic's medical director Dr. Lawrence Cohen had stepped down.

ABC News tweeted the news writing: ""Medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy where #JoanRivers went into cardiac arrest is out.

""He is no longer performing procedures at the clinic.""

While US gossip website TMZ reports that sources at the clinic say Dr. Lawrence Cohen - who is a world renowned gastroenterologist and co-owner of the clinic - stepped down after the board asked him to do so, but they're not directly blaming him for Joan's death.

A rep from the clinic confirmed he had stepped down from his position as medical director.

The clinic previously denied reports claiming they administered a general anaesthetic and conducted a vocal cord biopsy on the late star.

""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" a spokesperson for the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic said in a statement.

""General anaesthesia has never been administered. The type of sedation used at Yorkville Endoscopy is monitored anesthesia care. Our anesthesiologists utilise light to moderate sedation.""

According to the unnamed source, the alleged procedure should not be performed outside of a hospital.

Both the State Health Department and the New York City Medical Examiner's Office are still investigating the cause of Joan's death, after failing to determine how she died in a preliminary autopsy.

Her funeral - which took place on Sunday at the Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan - featured performances from Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman and The New York City Gay Men's Chorus, and was attended by friends and colleagues including Kelly Osbourne, Whoopi Goldberg and Sarah Jessica Parker.

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,2023,discuss,"Debate is raging online as to whether pic shows super-sized snapper of the Kent coast could be the biggest ever to grace UK shores

Is this Britain's biggest crab caught on camera?

The shock snap clicked from the air has caused a stir online, with many convinced it shows a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

But others claim the photo is fishy - and is nothing more than a oddly-shaped sandbank or a a bit of image manipulation.

The 'super crab' picture shows the harbour at Whitstable, Kent. And the unexplained 'creature of the deep' dwarfs fishing boats left on the nearby pier

The pic appeared on the website Weird Whitstable - a collection of the strange put together by Quinton Winter.

Weird Whitstable   Claws for concern: Is this picture shared on the internet the biggest crab the banks of Britain have ever seen?

He told the Daily Express that he saw the mega-crab last summer.

Quinton said: ""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood'.

""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

""Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

The world's largest recorded crab is the Japanese spider crab, a species which can grow to around 12ft and weigh up to three stone.

Crabzilla! Satellite Picture Reveals Giant Crustacean Lurking Off The Coast Of Whitstable,1624,discuss,"AUSTIN (KXAN) — This giant news is a colossal conundrum. That’s because a photo of a “Crabzilla” has people asking if it could be real, according to AOL. The creature in question: a 50-foot-long crab. The picture is reportedly an aerial image taken in the United Kingdom.

“The aerial shot enables viewers to see the full body of the crab, including its pinchers and legs,” says the AOL article.

The article also mentions a man who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual. He reportedly thought the creature in question was initially driftwood with a striking resemblance to a crab, but then later explained he now thinks the crab is real.

By the way, the largest known crab in the world is the Japanese spider crab. But even that one only measures up to about one-fourth the size of this alleged “Crabzilla.” They can measure 12 feet across from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds."
Bear attack foiled by Justin Bieber’s music: A story too good to check,2373,agree,"Reports of more attacks in Yakutia bears on people 53-year-old Igor Nerungri Vorozhbitsyn ignored, they say, for his life more than once met nose to nose with clumsy and all circuits. So as usual without fear went fishing in the nearby Aldan region. From the road, a man went to the creek to winter quarters where usually stayed fishing. Weapons of a knife on his belt in his hands - rods, behind - the backpack.
To rain at times forced to throw a tight long cloak. A few kilometers left on the old highway. Pereobulsya, Bolotnikov tied to a backpack and walked toward the key Evota to zymes.
Coming in a somewhat macabre silence about three hundred meters, clearly felt that the rear - risk. At the same moment a powerful blow to the backpack knocked him down. Falling, he saw a couple of meters of a huge bear.
Igor himself considerable size, weight under one hundred pounds. But pounce beast with incredible force began to throw it as a toy. Poor fisherman tried to pull a knife, but the bitten hand predator is not obeyed, hanging whip.
What happened next, other than a miracle not to name. Bear attacks in the final chord in the chest and grabbed at the moment mobile fisherman made a sound.
- In the taiga time looked - it was 8:30 pm and put a mobile phone in his breast pocket - recalls that terrible battle Vorozhbitsyn. - I have an older model. Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri.

ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,835,discuss,"The video comes after the beheading of journalist James Foley last month

Kashmira Gander writes for the Independent and Independent on Sunday

Tuesday 02 September 2014

Islamic State (IS) fighters have released a video which they claim shows the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff, followed by a threat that a British hostage could be next.

Sotloff, 31, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syria in August 2013 where he was working as a reporter.

Last month, he appeared at the end of a video released online by the extremist group formerly known as Isis that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

In the footage last month, Sotloff was pictured dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid landscape. IS fighters then threatened to kill Sotloff unless the US stopped air strikes against the group in Iraq.

The video distributed today begins with a short excerpt from a speech by US President Barack Obama on the fight against terror, followed by text that reads: ""A second message to America"". The IS fighter, who suggests he is the same man who killed Mr Foley, says: ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State...despite our serious warnings.""

He then appears to be behead Mr Sotloff.

The footage ends with the threat of presenting a British hostage, and issuing a warning to ""back-off and leave our people alone.""

Journalist Steven Sotloff, left, pictured in Libya in 2011 (Getty)  The White House has said it cannot confirm the authenticity of the video. Spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports, BBC New reported.

A US terrorism watchdog, the SITE Intelligence Group, first reported the video's existence.

Following Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother had appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to spare her son's life.

In a video in which she directly addressed the IS leader, she urged that her son was an ""an innocent journalist"" who had no control over US policy in the Middle East.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,764,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

It’s not entirely unsurprising. Thus far she seems to be enjoying the attention, writing on her Facebook page, “So I’m flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

BuzzFeed News has reached out to her for further comment.

Consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Nilesh Sojitra told BuzzFeed News:

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_3863178"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-09-22 10:32:25 -0400', 'update'); });"
Fox Affiliate Falls for College Humor's Office Note War Prank,1945,disagree,"CHICAGO (FOX 32 News) - A frustrated office worker recently called out his colleague for stealing his lunch, prompting a response from the ""sandwich thief"" himself.

The frustrated worker posted a sign on the fridge saying, ""To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (turkey and Swiss with mayo on rye), this is ridiculous. We are full grown adults, not children. Please take responsibility for your actions and stop stealing other people's property!""

The sandwich thief then came back with a response, asking for ransom money for the stolen turkey and Swiss on rye.

""Dear turkey and Swiss on rye, I have your precious sandwich. It's safe. For now. Put 10 dollars on the plate in the fridge or you'll never see it undigested again.""

HR then got involved in the situation and told the alleged thief to give back the sandwich and it won't be investigated.
But it was too late, the sandwich thief already had eaten the coveted lunch! But he didn't get away with it. HR was able to track down the crook.

ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,799,discuss,"ISIL has released a second video allegedly showing the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff, according to SITE Intelligence Group.

The terrorist group had previously claimed Sotloff would be killed if the U.S. continued to attack in Iraq in a video released Aug. 19. That threat came in the same video where journalist James Foley was executed by the same group. The new video allegedly also threatens David Cawthorne Haines, a British hostage.

The Wire spoke with Joe Cleffie of SITE to gather more information about the video, which the group found on ""one of the jihadi forums.""

""We wouldn't send it out without verifying it,"" Cleffie offered. ""It's him being beheaded.""

SITE has transcribed the video on its website. In the video, Sotloff says he is ""paying the price"" for U.S. intervention in Iraq, while the same masked fighter who appeared in the video of Foley stands behind him and states the following:

I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State, because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and [unclear] on Mosul Dam, despite our serious warnings. You, Obama, have but to gain from your actions but another American citizen. So just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people...

We take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.

Below is a transcript of Sotloff's statement in the video:

I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I'm sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now this time for my message:

Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life. Am I not an American citizen? You've spent billions of U.S. tax payers dollars and we've lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?

From what little I know about foreign policy, I remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo. Here you are now, Obama, nearing the end of your term, and having achieving none of the above, and deceivingly marching us the American people in the blazing fire.

Sotloff had disappeared while reporting in Syria in August 2013. Following his appearance in the video of Foley's beheading, Sotloff's mother, Shirley, issued a video plea to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asking for her son's return.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily briefing Tuesday he had not seen the video or the reports of Sotloff's death.

He noted the U.S. military effort to rescue Sotloff and Foley in July, which failed when the hostages were not at the location they targeted.

""Our thoughts and prayers first and foremost are with Mr. Sotloff and his family,"" Earnest said. He added that he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity"" of the latest video.

Any new video, he said, would be ""analyzed very carefully by the U.S. government and its intelligence officials to determine its authenticity.""

According to BBC, British Prime Minister David Cameron has also condemned the video:


Just before 2 p.m., The Wire received the video showing which reportedly shows the assassination of Steven Sotloff. Please note this description of the video is graphic.

The video, which is extremely graphic in nature, was edited in a manner similar to the beheading video of James Foley. The beginning of the video shows President Obama speaking in regards to ISIL and airstrikes several weeks ago. In the next scene, Sotloff introduces himself. Sotloff appears with similarly short hair as Foley did in his video, and with a beard. He is in a similar desert area, wearing the same orange robe as Foley. The area in which this is filmed is extremely windy, unlike Foley's environment during the beheading video.

After Sotloff's brief statement, the executioner speaks and is shown putting the knife to Sotloff's neck. However, just like the Foley video, the murder scene is edited. The video shows only the knife being held up and then the decapitated body, positioned in the same manner as Sotloff's. Once again, a very short dagger, rather than a long blade, is used. The blade may be the same as in the first video. This differs greatly from traditional ISIL execution videos which have circulated the web.

The end of the video shows a  British man, David Cawthrone Haines. The executioner briefly stands next to Haines, grabbing his shirt (another long, orange robe like that of Sotloff and Foley) before releasing him and stepping to the side. The video then turns black and white, quite blurry, before ending. The executioner does not hold a knife when showing Haines, and there may be a slight murmur of background noise from others before the video ends.

Of particular note are three major edits: the black screens introducing each part of the video, the editing out of Sotloff's executioner, and the executioner's voice. The voice sounds as though it may have been manipulated after the video was shot. While the man in the video appears similar to Foley's executioner, he sounds slightly deeper and more computerized. In the first video, the voice is being used to identify the executioner, and this may be the reason for the change in this second video.

'Crabzilla' or 'Crapzilla' -- You Decide,2282,discuss,"IS it Crabzilla or Claws? This aerial image of a giant crab lurking at a British resort has become an internet sensation.

People have been flocking to a website to judge for themselves whether this picture shows a huge crustacean in shallow water at a harbour mouth in Kent or is just an elaborate hoax.

Quinton Winter, who collates strange and spooky sightings for his Weird Whitstable website, at first thought the image sent to him by a follower showed an unusual sand formation in the shape of a crab but is now convinced it’s a true monster of the deep.

**CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE CREATURES IN DIGUISE**

He believes he saw the giant lurking close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer in the harbour at Whitstable, which is famed for its oysters.

He said: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

The picture appears to show an edible crab, scientific name cancer pagurus, a species commonly found in British water but which normally only grows to 10 inches, weighing six pounds.

The biggest known crab species is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
NEWS/ Viral Video: What Happens When You Accidentally Catcall Your Mom,994,agree,"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima."
ISIS Beheads Second American Journalist,2298,discuss,"The National Security Council says it is ""appalled"" by the apparent beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,"" NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. ""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The NSC's statement came within an hour after ISIL reportedly released a video showing the murder of Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist who had written for Time, Foreign Policy and National Interest. According to the monitoring service SITE Intelligence Group, Sotloff was beheaded in the same manner as James Foley, the photojournalist who was killed last month. The executioner is reportedly the same man who killed Foley and threatened to kill Sotloff in the video released on Aug. 19.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that the White House could not immediately confirm the validity of the video but that ""our thoughts and prayers"" are with the Sotloff family."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,2258,discuss,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

Third boob likely a hoax,1903,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist in Tampa, Florida, claims that she had a third breast implanted to get famous, land a reality show, and become ""unattractive to men"" because she doesn't ""want to date anymore."" From CBS Tampa Bay:

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

That’s because a photo of a “Crabzilla” has people asking if it could be real, according to AOL. The creature in question: a 50-foot-long crab.

Transgender teen struck and killed on Ohio interstate in apparent suicide,2198,discuss,"A 17-year-old transgender girl in Ohio committed suicide by walking into traffic early Sunday morning.

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan, left behind a harrowing note posted on Tumblr that exposed the pain, frustration and rejection Leelah felt, including her feeling that “there’s no way out,” and her concern that she would never fully transition.

Leelah died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after she was hit by a tractor trailer near the  South Lebanon exit of I-71. While initial news reports seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids.

Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.

On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

Later, she detailed her emotional turmoil.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy.

Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me.

As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.

I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

Leelah was being home-schooled at the time of her death.

This Woman Claims To Have Had Plastic Surgery To Have A Third Breast,1092,discuss,"Though we had serious suspicions, we wanted to believe so badly that the story of Jasmine Tridevil, the Tampa woman who claimed to have gotten a third boob implanted in order to appear unattractive to men, was real. But now, a final piece of evidence confirms the whole thing was a hoax.

This is Hessler's second run-in with viral fame: Back in December 2013, she made a man wear a dunce cap and a sign that says ""I beat women"" on a busy street corner after he reportedly beat her up. Hessler never followed up with police following the incident.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

A top plastic surgeon, Mr Nilesh Sojitra, also cast doubt over the surgery after claiming no ‘reasonable’ doctor would perform the operation

‘Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would,’ he told Buzzfeed.

Meet the 3-boobed woman,2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,1421,agree,"The tradition to stop stigma about the 'lobison' has continued for a century

The President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.

Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.

Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.

She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a “magical moment”.

Calling the Tawils a “marvellous family” she described Yair as “a total sweety” and dubbed his mother “Queen Esther.”

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers.

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2439,discuss,"The 81-year-old comedienne was supposed to only have a routine procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28, but it took an ultimately fatal turn. Her personal doctor paused to snap a self-portrait while she was under anesthesia, CNN reported.

Joan Rivers’ personal doctor stopped to take a selfie in the procedure room while the famous comedienne was under anesthesia, just moments before she went into cardiac arrest, CNN reported Tuesday.

Rivers, 81, was getting a routine scoping of her throat at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28 when her own physician performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords, a source told the Daily News.

The procedure sent the famed funny woman into a death spiral.

A staff member at the Upper East Side clinic told CNN that the personal physician — who was not authorized to practice medicine at the private facility — paused to snap a self-portrait.

Rivers was at the clinic for a routine endoscopy by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen.

Cohen has since been let go by the clinic. Rivers’ personal physician has not yet been named.

Rivers died Sept. 4 at Mount Sinai hospital. She never regained consciousness after the botched biopsy."

ISIS Reported to Behead Second American,2063,discuss,"An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist being held hostage by the militants.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed.

After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.

The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions.

Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.

""I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports,"" he said.

""If there is a video that's been released, it's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity."""
Saudi Arabia May Be Taking Misogyny to the Skies,1557,discuss,"It may be 2015, but one airline reportedly has plans to gender separate their passengers completely. Due to religious and modesty regulations, the airline plans to “enforce” separation, according to a spokesman for the company.

The airline in question is Saudi Arabia’s national airline, Saudia as reported on the RT website. Saudia wants to separate male and female air travellers, mainly due to complaints from husbands who don’t like unknown men sitting next to their wives.

Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told reporters, “There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

As such, the airline hopes to begin arranging for check-in staff at the airport to assign separate seating for their passengers, unless they are closely related.

As widely reported, it isn’t just Muslims who have these modesty issues as Orthodox Jews also have similar laws calling for the separation of men and women in public.

Back in September, an El AL flight from New York to Israel’s Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport was delayed because some orthodox male flyers refused to sit next to women.

But while these religious practices are all fine for some people, they are not suitable for others, and certainly not on a public place like an airplane, where flight crews are constantly working against the clock to ensure their aircraft takes off on time.

It terms of the FAA’s rules for this type of crew disruption, Federal Aviation Regulations 91.11, 121.580 and 135.120 state that “no person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crewmember in the performance of the crewmember’s duties aboard an aircraft being operated.”

It therefore remains to be seen what course of action will be taken by Saudia airlines, and if plans to separate people based on gender is even legal, not to mention the logistical and ethical nightmare."
Woman with three breasts: Real or hoax?,2486,discuss,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

ISIS is suspected of selling human organs for money in Iraq,1842,discuss,"UNITED NATIONS – Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

He also said a dozen doctors have been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an acronym for the group.

He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mladenov said."

(KMOV.com) -- This St. Louis woman’s picture and story has spread through social media, she’s now ready to talk about what happened to her shortly after the grand jury announcement was made in the death of Michael Brown.
Dornella Conners is now blind in her left eye and can hardly see out of her right eye after her and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, stopped at a gas station in the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday morning. Conners says as she and her boyfriend were driving away from the station multiple police officers showed up.
“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street, De’Anglas was trying to get away, they blocked us from the side, front and back,” Conners said.
Conners says her boyfriend was trying to drive around St. Louis County Police but police say he drove towards them. Police say the officer, fearing for his safety, used his less lethal bean bag round, striking the front passenger window causing it to shatter.
Conner went to another police officer who helped her get medical attention.
“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of situation,” said Donnell Conners, Dornella’s father. “I understand tough job, I understand that it was chaos, there was no reason to fire upon innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”
Police say Lee drove away but he was not the only one causing trouble at the gas station. Sixteen people were arrested on the lot and police say they still do not know who is responsible for firing numerous gunshots at the location.

Police say they have issued a warrant for Lee’s arrest and set a bond for $50,000."
ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,79,discuss,"DEVELOPING: An Internet video purports to show the beheading of US reporter Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State extremist group.

The global terror intelligence firm SITE first reported the release of the video, titled ""A Second Message to America,"" in which Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, speaks to the camera before a cloaked Islamic State fighter decapitates him.

“I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing,” Sotloff said. ""Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?”

The video then cuts to the masked militant warning that as long as U.S. missiles “continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.” He also threatens the life of British captive David Cawthorne Haines.

The grim video comes just days after Sotloff's mother, Shirley, directly addressed the leader of the Islamic State last week, saying her son shouldn't pay for U.S. government actions in the Middle East and that he cared about the weak and oppressed as a journalist.

""I want what every mother wants, to live to see her children's children,"" she said last week. ""I plead with you to grant me this.""

Shirley Sotloff cited by name the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has described himself as a caliph intending to lead the Muslim world. She had asked him to show mercy and follow the example of the prophet Muhammad in protecting people of Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths.

Sotloff was last seen in August 2013 in Syria. He was recently threatened with death by the militants on a video unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq. The same video showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley, 45.

Several U.S. officials, including U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., have said they were working behind the scenes to find out more about Sotloff and try to secure his release.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest could not confirm the reports when asked about the video at Tuesday’s press briefing. He noted the administration has been monitoring his situation carefully since threats were first made.

“The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff,” he said, adding “thoughts and prayers” are with the family.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the intelligence community will work “as quickly as possible” to determine the video’s authenticity.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act taking the life of another innocent American citizen,” she told reporters.

Pressed by Fox News, Psaki would not say whether this would constitute an act of war. She said the prior execution of journalist James Foley was a “horrific terrorist act,” and was a “motivating” factor for creating a coalition to address the Islamic State.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."

[John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,” Aburisha told CBS News’ Jennifer Janisch. “We have received promises and we hope that these promises will materialize in reality on the ground.”

‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,1128,agree,"A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she said.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad ... he really isn’t happy ... he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticised Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci fi film Total Recall.

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like ... we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.

iPhone 6s Rumored to Include 2GB of Faster RAM and 'Force Touch' Technology,1980,discuss,"For its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus follow-up expected to debut in 2015, Apple may introduce a handset with dual lenses in what one well-connected Apple pundit calls the ""biggest camera jump ever.""

On the most recent episode of The Talk Show podcast, Daring Fireball's John Gruber revealed that ""a birdie of a birdie"" told him Apple is working on a two-lens system for incorporation in the next-generation iPhone.

""The specific thing I heard is that next year's camera might be the biggest camera jump ever,"" Gruber said. ""I don't even know what sense this makes, but I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.""

The notion of using multi-lens imaging systems to make up for a smartphone's small form factor is a relatively recent development. In March, HTC unveiled the One M8 with a so-called ""Duo camera"" setup, which uses a secondary imaging sensor for depth data.

An interesting startup called Corephotonics, which was profiled by Engadget earlier this year, proposes a different approach. Corephotonics developed a dual-lens module with two distinct focal lengths, effectively negating resolution drops associated with digital zooming. One camera is used for wide shots, while the other is used for close-ups. As an added bonus, the system provides spatial data for 3D imagery due to its lens offset.

While speculation, Apple could employ a similar system, or even stitch together image data from both camera modules, to achieve DSLR-quality high-resolution photos. The company has no shortage of patents covering smartphone camera technology, including Lytro-like refocusing, interchangeable modules and interchangeable external lenses.

Perhaps most similar to today's rumor is an invention for a multi-sensor system that gathers luminance and chrominance values separately, processes the data and outputs photos at exceptionally high resolutions with equally high color accuracy."

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,1546,disagree,"The crabs human see or eat are usually only six or so inches across their shells.

Quinton Winter, who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual, is one of the folks who has seen the picture. Initially, he believed he was looking at a bizarre sand formation that bore a striking resemblance to a crab. However, he now thinks it is indeed a real-life crab -- one that he actually saw in person last summer. Winter explained, 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'That's a funny looking bit of driftwood.' It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.'

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

Saudi Arabia’s national airline, Saudia is allegedly considering seating male and female passengers apart from each other, according to Emirates247.

Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, “There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.” The airline will supposedly begin having airport staff assign separate seating for men and women, unless they are closely related.

It’s not only Muslims that are concerned over seating assignments, but also Orthodox Jews. An El Al Airlines flight in September from New York to Israel was delayed because some men refused to be seated next to women…

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,1755,discuss,"The doctor - named as Dr. Gwen Korovin - refused to comment when cameras approached her today, but has reportedly told friends it's false

The doctor who reportedly took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia has denied she ever took the photo, according to reports.

The woman, who has been identified as Dr. Gwen Korovin according to TMZ , refused to comment when photographers spotted her heading to work in New York a matter of hours ago - but friends now insist it's ""lies"".

According to TMZ, Dr Korovin also told friends she never performed a biopsy, as has been claimed, and added CNN's source - who originally broke the story about the selfie - is ""making up lies"".

But sources were unable to say if the doctor performed any other procedure.

It comes shortly after she was spotted rushing past photographers today, refusing to comment when asked about the claims (see video below).

Dr Korovin wouldn't look at the camera when she was asked to comment in New York, and walked straight inside despite photographers shouting questions about the procedure and alleged selfie.

Arriving at work with a companion to protect her from cameras, the doctor hid behind huge sunglasses as she was ushered inside.

It’s thought Dr Gwen, who is an ear, nose and throat doctor to the stars, was working as Joan’s personal doctor when she attended the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 to undergo a routine procedure.

Mirror Celeb have contacted for comment.

On Wednesday it was claimed that the doctor, now believed to be Gwen, took a selfie with the star while she was under anaesthesia.

The incident allegedly occurred in Manhattan's Yorkville ­Endoscopy shortly before Joan, 81, underwent a procedure on her vocal chords that could have led to her suffering a cardiac arrest, CNN reports.

The clinic have made it very clear that they did not perform the alleged biopsy or put the comedienne under anaesthesia.

Following Joan’s death Dr. Lawrence - who is a world renowned gastroenterologist and co-owner of the clinic – resigned from his position.

And it seems it’s not her first time in the limelight – she previously appeared in a Celine Dion documentary.

The doctor, whose offices are on East 77th Street, New York, has previously worked with Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Hugh Jackman.

Her office walls are believed to be lined with pictures of the famous people she has looked after over the years.

ISIL Has Reportedly Beheaded Journalist Steven Sotloff,1031,discuss,"e Islamic State militant group released a video today purporting to show the beheading of U.S. hostage Steven J. Sotloff.

A masked figure in the video also issued a threat against a British hostage, a man the group named as David Haines, and warned governments to back off ""this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State"", the SITE Intelligence Group monitoring service said.

Sotloff, a freelance journalist, was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. Sotloff's mother Shirley appealed on Aug. 27 in a videotaped message to Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, for her son's release.

The White House said it could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing that if there is such a video, it would be analyzed very carefully, adding that the administration's thoughts and prayers were with Sotloff's family.

Shortly before the briefing, the SITE monitoring service said the militant group had released the video.

On Aug. 19 the group published a video showing the beheading of U.S. hostage James Foley, a Marquette and Northwestern alum. The group said his death was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes on fighters in Iraq.

That video was issued after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq in August for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011.

After Islamic State's beheading of journalist James Foley, President Barack Obama's administration is making little headway in efforts to secure the release of other Americans held by the insurgent group in Syria, officials said.

The U.S. government has said it does not pay ransoms or negotiate with the Islamic State.

Washington has contacted about two dozen countries for help in freeing the three, but no foreign government appears to have influence over or even significant contact with IS, which has declared an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.

""What we've found is that ISIS isn't responsive"" to outreach, said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity and using an alternate acronym for the group.

Another administration official said Washington was working with other Western countries whose citizens are being held hostage, and with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and others in the region thought by the United States to possibly have influence with the groups Al-Nusrah and IS.

The hostages' fate received little public attention until Islamic State posted an online video on Aug. 19 showing Foley's beheading. It now presents a frustrating challenge for Obama.

Islamic State ""is far more difficult to deal with"" than Iran or the militant group Hezbollah, which also took Americans captive, said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official now at the Brookings Institution think-tank. The group ""wants to terrorize Americans, it's not really interested in deals.""

WHITE HOUSE INVOLVEMENT
U.S. officials and supporters of the remaining hostages requested that most details about them and efforts to free them be withheld.

One of the other U.S. hostages is a female aid worker, age 26, for whom Islamic State has demanded $6.6 million in ransom, according to ABC News.

Lisa Monaco, Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser, has been ""very deeply involved in this,"" the senior U.S. official said. Monaco, along with the State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, has been in contact with hostages' families, the official said.

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said, "" The Administration has had regular interactions with the families of those Americans who have been held hostage in Syria since the kidnapping of their loved ones. These interactions included representatives from all the relevant agencies, including the Department of State, the FBI, the Intelligence Community, and the White House.""

Obama authorized a covert raid in Syria in July to rescue Foley and other American hostages, but they were not at the site where they were thought to be held. Another rescue attempt would be risky for U.S. special forces and the hostages.

The American diplomatic effort also is aimed at persuading European countries not to pay ransoms, officials said.


U.S. and European officials have said that France, Spain and Italy have tolerated or facilitated ransom payments for citizens held in Syria. Islamic State released numerous European journalists this year, including two Spaniards in March and four Frenchmen in April.

The French government has denied a news report that it paid a ransom to free the four. Spain's foreign ministry has not commented on the matter.

The U.S. policy of refusing to pay ransoms to discourage further hostage-taking ""is as close as we are likely to come to governments influencing ISIS on the matter of seizing hostages"", said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA analyst now at Georgetown University.

U.S. officials have said that Qatar played a critical role in persuading a rival group in Syria, the official al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, to free American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, whom it had been holding since 2012.

Qatar is working to help free other Americans held captive in Syria, a Gulf source told Reuters, but U.S. officials said the Qatari government has little if any leverage with Islamic State.

"Beast-eater, frightened phone signal, threw the victim and rend in the taiga",2373,agree,"Reports of more attacks in Yakutia bears on people 53-year-old Igor Nerungri Vorozhbitsyn ignored, they say, for his life more than once met nose to nose with clumsy and all circuits. So as usual without fear went fishing in the nearby Aldan region. From the road, a man went to the creek to winter quarters where usually stayed fishing. Weapons of a knife on his belt in his hands - rods, behind - the backpack.
To rain at times forced to throw a tight long cloak. A few kilometers left on the old highway. Pereobulsya, Bolotnikov tied to a backpack and walked toward the key Evota to zymes.
Coming in a somewhat macabre silence about three hundred meters, clearly felt that the rear - risk. At the same moment a powerful blow to the backpack knocked him down. Falling, he saw a couple of meters of a huge bear.
Igor himself considerable size, weight under one hundred pounds. But pounce beast with incredible force began to throw it as a toy. Poor fisherman tried to pull a knife, but the bitten hand predator is not obeyed, hanging whip.
What happened next, other than a miracle not to name. Bear attacks in the final chord in the chest and grabbed at the moment mobile fisherman made a sound.
- In the taiga time looked - it was 8:30 pm and put a mobile phone in his breast pocket - recalls that terrible battle Vorozhbitsyn. - I have an older model. Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri. Four hours of operation, and three surgeons literally collected on parched face bloodied pieces Igor. Then - three operations already in the Republican Hospital in Yakutsk. Fortunately, the fisherman left eye was saved. Igor saved and that the first shot hit on the head is not (bear paw easily cut out the skull), and a backpack. Played a protective role and dense coat. Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. But by a happy coincidence did not touch the internal organs and even ribs broken. And if not for mobile ...

While doctors saved Igor Vorozhbitsyna hunters looking for a bear attacked him. Evoty literally combed the neighborhood with dogs. And on July 26 shot clumsy 2-3 years old.

HP announces plan to split in two,1994,agree,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +6.68%  on Monday said it plans to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the latest attempt by the technology company to improve its fortunes by breaking itself in two.

The company will make the split through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders by the end of fiscal 2015.

If the division goes off as planned, it would give rise to two publicly traded companies, each with more than $50 billion in annual revenue.

H-P also boosted the number of its expected layoffs by 5,000 to 55,000, after identifying “incremental opportunities for reductions.” H-P had previously projected its job cuts to be between 45,000 and 50,000, and it has already shed 36,000 employees under the restructuring program as of the end of the most recent quarter.

A number of big companies, including eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  in tech, have chosen to break up lately, in part because of a belief that operations with different growth profiles are best managed as separate entities. H-P, which has suffered sharp sales declines, sees better long-term potential for its corporate hardware and services business than for its printer and PC unit, said one person familiar with the plan.

The impending move, first reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, set off a round of speculation in the industry about whether the separation could lead to more deal making.

The Journal recently reported that for much of the past year, H-P held talks to merge with data-storage equipment maker EMC Corp. EMC +0.49%  , a deal that would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion. Although the talks recently ended, the separation could pave the way for H-P’s corporate hardware and services business to ultimately be combined with EMC, industry observers said.

The planned breakup is one that Palo Alto, Calif.-based H-P and its investors have long contemplated. H-P came close to hiving off its PC operation in 2011, when it announced the ill-fated acquisition of U.K. software company Autonomy Corp. H-P said then it was exploring a separation of its PC business, only to decide two months later to hold on to it amid pressure from shareholders, which led to the departure of then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker.

H-P in 1999 spun off Agilent Technologies, A +1.93%  a maker of electronic-testing gear and other hardware. Agilent subsequently announced plans to break itself up.


H-P chief Meg Whitman is slated to be chairman of a PC and printer business, while remaining CEO of a separate company selling corporate hardware and services. Associated Press
In 2012, under current H-P Chief Executive Meg Whitman, the company reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation, helping pave the way for the current plan.

Ms. Whitman is slated to be chairman of the PC and printer business, to be known as HP Inc., and CEO of the other company, to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Current lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business.

H-P, which affirmed its guidance for the year ending Oct. 31, said it expects per-share earnings of $3.83 to $4.03 for fiscal 2015. The range doesn’t include one-time charges expected to be connected to the separation. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting $3.95 a share.

In the 2013 fiscal year ended last October, the Printing and Personal Systems Group, as it is known, reported $55.9 billion in revenue, about half of H-P’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for company revenue as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK +0.68%  , according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since the beginning of last year, but they remain well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached during the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% on Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

In response to lower sales and to provide a lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as “cloud” software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

The recent wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world has been fueled by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—and sometimes actively sought by them.

Last Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay, where Ms. Whitman was once CEO, announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1632,agree,"Jasmine Tridevil's 'three breasts' have gotten their 15 minutes of fame, but they've finally been exposed as a sham after all.

Florida station 10 News has now outed Tridevil third breast as fake after obtaining a luggage theft report filed earlier this month by the 21-year-old at Tampa International Airport.

In the report, Tridevil (going by her real name Alisha Hessler) lists the contents of a bag which was stolen off the American Airlines conveyor belt, including a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' inside.

Cops eventually tracked down the thieves using surveillance footage, and returned Hessler's black nylon bag - but not before taking an official inventory.

The report, filed earlier this month at Tampa International Airport, lists a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' as one of the contents of Tridevil's lost bag. It was eventually tracked down and returned

Contents: The above property receipt shows that Hessler's suitcase was stolen at Tampa International Aiport and returned earlier this month with a '3 breast prosthesis' inside

Earlier Tuesday, Tridevil's story began to fall apart when internet-rumor site Snopes connected the young woman to a Tampa, Florida massage therapist named Alisha Hessler.

Snopes discovered that the website JasmineTridevil.com is registered to a person named Alisha Hessler, and that Tridevil bares striking resemblance to a Tampa masseuse named Alisha Jasmine Hessler .

A website for Hessler's business - Alisha's Golden Touch - lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoaxes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted women'.

If Alisha Hessler is the woman behind Jasmine Tridevil, it may not be the fist time she has made national news.

In December 2013, a Tampa woman named Alisha Hessler made headlines when she had a alleged attacker stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding up a sign that reads 'I beat women'.

Likeness: YouTube videos of Hessler showing off her massage skills also bare a similarity to Tridevil, who says she underwent the procedure to become unattractive to men

A view of the home where Alisha Jasmine Hessler, aka Jasmine Tridevilm lives in Tampa Florida on Tuesday, September 23

Police tried to contact Hessler about the alleged attack outside a night club but she 'stopped returning [their] calls' and never filed formal charges.

In March 2013, she was taken into custody in Hillsborough County, Florida and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'.

News of Tridevil's third breast emerged Monday, when she announced that she paid $20,000 for the addition in order to become a reality star.

She says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Hessler has gone into hiding since news of Tridevil grabbed national attention.

She was nowhere to be seen at her run down home in one of Tampa's poorer neighborhoods.

And if Hessler really is Tridevil, her 80-year-old grandfather Kenneth appeared not to have any idea about the radical transformation.

Attention grabber? In December 2013, a woman also named Alisha Hessler made national headlines when she alleged that she was attacked outside a nightclub by a man

News maker: Hessler subsequently made the man stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign reading 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. The story made national news

Speaking to MailOnline from his home in North Barrington, Illinois he said: 'We don't know what to believe. We did not know a thing about this'.

While Tridevil claims to have paid $20,000 for the operation, Hessler's rundown home in Tampa suggests someone who has struggled to make ends meet.

A decaying leather sofa had been dumped outside the tile and brick single story home which has rusting iron bars covering the downstairs windows.

Liar: Hessler was also arrested in March 2013 and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'

Broken plastic blinds have been drawn and the front garden is overgrown with weeds.

Neighbors said they hardly saw Hessler.

'She keeps very odd hours,' said one neighbor. 'You'd see her coming in at 6am when I'd be leaving to drive to work. She seemed nice enough but I don't believe her getting another breast. I just saw it on the news and it's fake. She just wants to make a name for herself.'

Other facts of Tridevil's story also don't line up, like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a WTSP reporter this week.

'I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet,' Jasmine said. '[Because] that's also going to be on my show where I'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and I want to save that.'

The only other pictures of her third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged...other than the WTSP footage.

In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs.

Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.

Selfies: The only pictures to emerge of Tridevil's third breast are self made. Tridevil did show her breast, but only very briefly to a WTSP reporter this week. She said she wasn't comfortable showing the breast too long because she wants to save it for her self-produced reality show

Scam? Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler is pictured above in the social media photos. She owns the domain name to JasmineTridevil.com

However, Tridevil claims a surgeon agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

MailOnline's calls to Hessler were not answered Tuesday morning.

Third boob likely a hoax,2291,discuss,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

There is no way to confirm if Tridevil’s breast implant is real but she has been gaining thousands of Facebook and Twitter fans since the story broke Monday morning. So: mission accomplished, either way."
Woman with three breasts: Real or hoax?,1741,discuss,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."
"Fake or freak? Woman, 21, claims to have paid $20,000 to surgically add third breast in desperate bid to become a reality TV star",1092,discuss,"Though we had serious suspicions, we wanted to believe so badly that the story of Jasmine Tridevil, the Tampa woman who claimed to have gotten a third boob implanted in order to appear unattractive to men, was real. But now, a final piece of evidence confirms the whole thing was a hoax.

WTSP has uncovered a stolen luggage report from the Tampa International Airport that lists a ""3 breast prosthesis"" as part of the baggage. The report was filed by Alisha Hessler, a Tampa-area massage therapist, whom Snopes fingered as the evil genius behind the Tridevil persona.

This is Hessler's second run-in with viral fame: Back in December 2013, she made a man wear a dunce cap and a sign that says ""I beat women"" on a busy street corner after he reportedly beat her up. Hessler never followed up with police following the incident.

Sorry, dudes: It appears your Total Recall sex fantasies have been temporarily sidelined."
‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,1490,disagree,"Jasmine Tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob, but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff. Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible, it is not plausible.

""[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” Dr. Matthew Schulman, a board-certified plastic surgeon in New York, told the Daily Dot. “I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.""

There are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevil’s story. The first is the photographic “evidence” of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered, the Daily Dot wrote.

Second, creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required.

When asked about her surgery, Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She didn’t mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery.

The final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevil’s third breast is fake was the final result. “This technique would create a tight, round breast in the center of the chest,” he said. “Also, all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft, pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast, and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure.”

During a radio interview, Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a “striking” resemblance to Alisha Hessler, the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVIL.com is registered.

Hessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her, Snopes wrote. She reportedly made a man hold a sign that said “I beat women.” She withdrew her complaint with the police department after she was asked for details about the alleged attack, Buzzfeed wrote.

Tridevil said on her Facebook account Tuesday Alisha Hessler is her real name. She also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone else’s identification to get into a club. “I was underage and wanted to get drunk lol,” she wrote.

She told The Sun her claim is not a hoax and her film crew recorded her procedure. She said she will release the footage when she gets a reality television show and “I really don’t care what people say about me.”

This Third Boob Is Probably Only Real in Our Hearts,2392,agree,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2301,agree,The woman who reported adding a third breast was lying and the story is a hoax.
Meet the 3-boobed woman,1286,discuss,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

We think you’ll agree Leeb’s prosthetics are pretty convincing – could it be that Tridevil simply followed suit and hasn’t been under the knife after all?"
These Men Catcalling Their Undercover Mothers Is the Best Payback Ever,1218,disagree,"""How nice pants"" (referring to the rear) is probably the last sentence expect to hear a mother her son, still less that the tell her. Since last November 23 flows through social networks a video of Peru where a clash between two street bullies with their mothers is simulated and already numbers more than three million views on Youtube.



Under the slogan Sílbale your mother , the sports brand Everlast and the organization Stop Street Harassment -the first Latin American Observatory against acoso- recorded a mockumentary in which pretended to have identified bullies then contact their mothers, you change their look and make it happen where their children were.

This performance by actors is based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed by mistake to a female relative and expressed ""deep shame"". Another inspiration for starting the campaign was the famous case of harassment suffered by the Peruvian actress Magaly Solier, star of The Empty Nest, while traveling on public transport. ""I'm cholera in Peru not put a stop to sexual harassment in the public media. The rapist has more rights than the victims,"" ​​said the actress after the incident last May.


Natalia Málaga, coach of the national women's volleyball team, is responsible for instructing mothers in this video with appearance of hidden camera that was released two days before the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and has viralizado especially through Facebook pages as that of Hora Cero Web , a Mexican digital newspaper where he has two million views.

In YouTube video has reached Friday three million copies and has been featured in several publications in media throughout Latin America. In the official pages of Everlast has been shared more than 100,000 times, making it the most successful viral country, according to information provided by Maria Paz Delgado, head of marketing for Everlast Peru.

Málaga had starred in August Everlast another campaign in calling the attention of drivers insulting to women using a vehicle as boxing glove."
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1092,agree,"Though we had serious suspicions, we wanted to believe so badly that the story of Jasmine Tridevil, the Tampa woman who claimed to have gotten a third boob implanted in order to appear unattractive to men, was real. But now, a final piece of evidence confirms the whole thing was a hoax.

WTSP has uncovered a stolen luggage report from the Tampa International Airport that lists a ""3 breast prosthesis"" as part of the baggage. The report was filed by Alisha Hessler, a Tampa-area massage therapist, whom Snopes fingered as the evil genius behind the Tridevil persona.

This is Hessler's second run-in with viral fame: Back in December 2013, she made a man wear a dunce cap and a sign that says ""I beat women"" on a busy street corner after he reportedly beat her up. Hessler never followed up with police following the incident.

Sorry, dudes: It appears your Total Recall sex fantasies have been temporarily sidelined."
The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,1907,disagree,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

Hewlett-Packard to split into two public companies,1552,discuss,"HP is set to cleave itself in two, splitting off its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. According to The Wall Street Journal, an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. ""Sources familiar with the matter"" tell the paper that current CEO Meg Whitman will become chairman of the PC and printer operation, and will remain CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler will become CEO of the personal computing business — he is currently a high-ranking executive in the division.

This is not the first time talk of splitting HP has surfaced. During some of the company's very tumultuous 2011, reports suggested that executives were close to making the very same decision to split off the enterprise division into its own business. After the departure of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, the company decided to keep the units together under the same corporate umbrella.

The company, based in Palo Alto, has struggled along with the rest of the PC industry as profit margins have slimmed and sales of Windows PC continue to steadily decline. The company's printer business is more lucrative than its PC operation, though the two were combined into the same unit back in 2012. That same year, HP lost the title of top-selling PC manufacturer to Lenovo."

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,2383,agree,"Cristina Kirchner, the president of Argentina, has ""adopted"" a Jewish boy in order, according to legend, to prevent him from turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil, 21, was born in the Argentine city of Rosario, the seventh son of Shlomo and Nehama Tawil.

Under Argentine legend – which reportedly originated in Tsarist Russia – any seventh consecutive son will grow up to become a werewolf. Any seventh daughter will become a witch.

The belief in the myth was so strong that, centuries ago, the seventh child was often put to death.

In 1907, in a bid to counter the myth, Jose Figeroa Alcorta, then-president of Argentina, became the godfather of José Brost, the seventh son of a Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann who had emigrated from Russia.

In 1973 President Juan Domingo Perón formalised the tradition of presidents becoming godparents to the seventh son or daughter, and a year later the ruling was enshrined in law. Those affected by law 20.843 – ""The Law of Presidential Godfathership"", were entitled to presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until the 21st birthday.

But the ruling only applied to Catholic families, and so in 1993 Mr and Mrs Tawil wrote to the president asking for the honour to be extended to their son, Yair.

The request was denied. But in 2009 the law was changed to apply to all – regardless of their religion.

And just before Christmas, Mrs Kirchner met with Yair, who became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvellous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther.""

She tweeted that the Tawils ""are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.""

Twitter: Cristina Kirchner - Es una familia muy especial. Tienen como paz, alegría y mucho amor. No es común. Buena vibra. http://t.co/QILUC11xR4

Mrs Kirchner adopted her first ""godson"" in 2008. In 2012 she adopted another, Natanael Eric, who was also born in Rosario, and last year three more boys – all of them born in the northern province of Santa Fe.

The Argentine president had been due to usher in the New Year with a visit to the Vatican, to see her compatriot Pope Francis.

But a fall on Boxing Day, when she slipped on a wet floor in her home, caused her to fracture her ankle.

On Monday it was announced that she had cancelled the trip and suspended official events for the beginning of next month."

When Street Harassers Realize The Women They're Catcalling Are Their Moms In Disguise,994,agree,"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima."

ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,799,discuss,"ISIL has released a second video allegedly showing the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff, according to SITE Intelligence Group.

The terrorist group had previously claimed Sotloff would be killed if the U.S. continued to attack in Iraq in a video released Aug. 19. That threat came in the same video where journalist James Foley was executed by the same group. The new video allegedly also threatens David Cawthorne Haines, a British hostage.

The Wire spoke with Joe Cleffie of SITE to gather more information about the video, which the group found on ""one of the jihadi forums.""

""We wouldn't send it out without verifying it,"" Cleffie offered. ""It's him being beheaded.""

SITE has transcribed the video on its website. In the video, Sotloff says he is ""paying the price"" for U.S. intervention in Iraq, while the same masked fighter who appeared in the video of Foley stands behind him and states the following:

I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State, because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and [unclear] on Mosul Dam, despite our serious warnings. You, Obama, have but to gain from your actions but another American citizen. So just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people...

We take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.

Below is a transcript of Sotloff's statement in the video:

I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I'm sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now this time for my message:

Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life. Am I not an American citizen? You've spent billions of U.S. tax payers dollars and we've lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?

From what little I know about foreign policy, I remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo. Here you are now, Obama, nearing the end of your term, and having achieving none of the above, and deceivingly marching us the American people in the blazing fire.

Sotloff had disappeared while reporting in Syria in August 2013. Following his appearance in the video of Foley's beheading, Sotloff's mother, Shirley, issued a video plea to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asking for her son's return.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily briefing Tuesday he had not seen the video or the reports of Sotloff's death.

He noted the U.S. military effort to rescue Sotloff and Foley in July, which failed when the hostages were not at the location they targeted.

""Our thoughts and prayers first and foremost are with Mr. Sotloff and his family,"" Earnest said. He added that he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity"" of the latest video.

Any new video, he said, would be ""analyzed very carefully by the U.S. government and its intelligence officials to determine its authenticity.""

According to BBC, British Prime Minister David Cameron has also condemned the video:


Just before 2 p.m., The Wire received the video showing which reportedly shows the assassination of Steven Sotloff. Please note this description of the video is graphic.

The video, which is extremely graphic in nature, was edited in a manner similar to the beheading video of James Foley. The beginning of the video shows President Obama speaking in regards to ISIL and airstrikes several weeks ago. In the next scene, Sotloff introduces himself. Sotloff appears with similarly short hair as Foley did in his video, and with a beard. He is in a similar desert area, wearing the same orange robe as Foley. The area in which this is filmed is extremely windy, unlike Foley's environment during the beheading video.

After Sotloff's brief statement, the executioner speaks and is shown putting the knife to Sotloff's neck. However, just like the Foley video, the murder scene is edited. The video shows only the knife being held up and then the decapitated body, positioned in the same manner as Sotloff's. Once again, a very short dagger, rather than a long blade, is used. The blade may be the same as in the first video. This differs greatly from traditional ISIL execution videos which have circulated the web.

The end of the video shows a  British man, David Cawthrone Haines. The executioner briefly stands next to Haines, grabbing his shirt (another long, orange robe like that of Sotloff and Foley) before releasing him and stepping to the side. The video then turns black and white, quite blurry, before ending. The executioner does not hold a knife when showing Haines, and there may be a slight murmur of background noise from others before the video ends.

Of particular note are three major edits: the black screens introducing each part of the video, the editing out of Sotloff's executioner, and the executioner's voice. The voice sounds as though it may have been manipulated after the video was shot. While the man in the video appears similar to Foley's executioner, he sounds slightly deeper and more computerized. In the first video, the voice is being used to identify the executioner, and this may be the reason for the change in this second video.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1924,disagree,"A Florida massage therapist said she paid $20,000 for a third breast in hopes of becoming less attractive to men

""I don't want to date anymore,"" Jasmine Tridevil told Orlando's Real Radio 104.1.

Tridevil, 21, has documented her post-surgery life through photos and videos posted to YouTube, Facebook and other social media sites -- mostly images of her posing in custom-made three-cup bikinis and bras.

Her desire to repel the opposite sex with her updated anatomy wasn't her only motivation for the surgery: Tridevil also hopes to have her own show on MTV someday.

Third boob likely a hoax,2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

The Foreign Office spokesman added: ‘We have a number of sources of information coming in.

‘The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don’t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.’

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ‘We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.’ A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

But until now, Jihadi John’s presence at the meeting has not emerged.

It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present.

The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present.

Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff

Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left

According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was ‘the one who slaughtered the journalists’.

It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.

IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosque’s loudspeakers, appealing for the town’s residents to donate blood at the hospital.

Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes.

The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regime’s 17th Division and 93rd Brigade.

Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left

Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal

Jihadi John has become one of the world’s most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.

Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.

Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS ‘wilayat’, or province.

IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.

Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.

He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured

The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards.

In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed.

Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to ‘erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere’.

The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturday’s attack.

The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leader’s house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property.

It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured

Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim.

He said: ‘A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.’

The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria.

It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured.

Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.

Also dead is a prominent IS fighter from Chechnya called Abu Abdul Rahman Al-Shishani, says the document."
The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,1128,disagree,"A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she said.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad ... he really isn’t happy ... he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticised Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci fi film Total Recall.

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like ... we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.

Third boob likely a hoax,764,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

BuzzFeed News has reached out to her for further comment.

Consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Nilesh Sojitra told BuzzFeed News:

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_3863178"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-09-22 10:32:25 -0400', 'update'); });"
Florida Woman Has Surgery To Add Third Breast To Her Chest,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Blood money: How ISIS is selling human organs harvested from living hostages and its own dead soldiers to fund terror across the Middle East,2194,discuss,"UNITED NATIONS -- Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.

Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

He also said a dozen doctors have been ""executed"" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an alternative acronym for the group.

He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.

""Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,"" Mladenov said.

Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq, 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January, he visited Washington to urge the U.S. to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar.

""Vice President Biden and Gen. [John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,"" Aburisha told CBS News' Jennifer Janisch.

And indeed, from the outset many were very suspicious of the authenticity of Tridevil's claims. Snopes.com, the urban legends website, took an in-depth look at her story and concluded the facts decisively pointed to a hoax.

And now perhaps the final piece of evidence: 10 News has received an an incident report from Tampa International Airport, where earlier this month Tridevil (real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler) reported her baggage had been stolen.

The luggage was eventually recovered and two people were arrested for stealing several bags off of the airport conveyor belts. When Tridevil went to retrieve her recovered items, a property receipt was written that listed the contents contained within:

"Three-Boobed Girl probably a hoax, because obviously",2392,agree,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"

No gender segregation on Saudia,605,discuss,"An airliner in Saudi Arabia has a new in-flight plan for its passengers that involves segregation. The country’s national airline is introducing new seating assignments that will be based on gender separation. The commercial flight service, in keeping with Saudi Islamic law, is responding to complaints from passengers about males sitting next to their wives, according to a Daily Mail news report.

Saudi Arabia’s national airline fielded a string of complaints from a number of male fliers who are protesting other males sitting next to their spouses and other female relatives. Accordingly, the airline met over creating rules for passengers in order to remain in strict compliance with laws that govern Islam in the Gulf kingdom.

Women soon to be segregated aboard Saudi planes.

Future plans are to institute segregation rules aboard Saudi Arabia Airlines flights. In short, males and females will not be allowed to sit adjacent to one another unless they are closes relatives. The concern is that the rules will clash with passengers who represent other nationalities and do not practice Islamic laws. Saudi assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd weighed in on the subject.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.”

Although the new plans for separating men and women aboard flights is part of a new initiative, most Saudi Arabia customs are already practiced aboard commercial airlines in the region. Several examples; pork dishes and alcohol, which are served aboard passenger planes in the West and other nation states, are forbidden on Middle Eastern and Sharia observant flights. Additionally, a verse from the Qur’an is read with accompanying an prayer before every flight, and international flights offer an on-board prayer room for men only.

Although the country does not allow Saudi women to work as cabin crew members, they employ the services of women from other countries. Moreover, Saudi Arabia Airlines’ segregation extends to the ground. In November, the company opened its fourth all-women office in the Murooj district of Saudi capital, Riyadh, wrote DM.

Some say the move to segregate women and men aboard Saudi airliners violates United Nations laws on human rights. Nonetheless, practitioners of Islamic law point to custom and religion, saying it’s not used to oppress women.

Still, many others say it’s pure gender inequality and has no place in the modern world. It’s known that women in Gulf states are required to enter and exit using special doors in public spaces. Months ago, Inquistir reported that women with “pretty eyes” are being forced to cover them up to prevent temptation.

Additionally, women are forbidden to socialize with another male unless he is a close relative. If she does, charges can include prostitution, fornication and adultery. The penalties are harsh and can include stoning and death. The new Saudi Arabian airline segregation policy will undoubtedly fan the flames in the ongoing debate between what many view as oppressive religious laws and human rights.

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."

When Photos Lead a Protest,1879,discuss,"Rumors swirled over the weekend that demonstrators in Hong Kong were using the “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

On Sunday, Vox published a story headlined, “Hong Kong’s protesters are using the same ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ gesture used in Ferguson.”

While the article did note that “it’s impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson,” it concluded contending that “it’s fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there.”

Other similar stories followed soon after. MSNBC published an article Monday titled, “In Hong Kong, protesters say ‘hands up, don’t shoot!’” The Daily Mail published a story saying that protesters in Hong Kong had copied the gesture used by U.S. demonstrators.

But, a story in Quartz Sunday appeared to challenge the idea that the gesture used by Hong Kong demonstrators was linked to Ferguson.

According to the story, the gesture used by those in Hong Kong was not a deliberate show of solidarity:

Most Hong Kong protesters aren’t purposefully mimicking “hands up, don’t shoot,”as some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.

Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, “I don’t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.” Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, with the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that “Hong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.” (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)

The Washington Post followed up Monday with a similar analysis:

Sunday, Max Fisher wrote a story for Vox.com arguing that the ‘hands up don’t shoot’ gesture had spread from protests in Ferguson to the pro-democracy demonstrations on the streets of Hong Kong. However, another writer at Quartz.com, who has actually interviewed protesters, says that this is wrong. The evidence seems to show that the gesture had probably not in fact ‘spread’ as Fisher and other commentators believed. Instead, the activists organizing the protests appear to have independently chosen to hold their hands up to emphasize their peaceful intentions to police.

Vox later corrected their post, addressing the controversy.

“Still, Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use, even if only subconsciously,” their story now argues.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1092,agree,"Though we had serious suspicions, we wanted to believe so badly that the story of Jasmine Tridevil, the Tampa woman who claimed to have gotten a third boob implanted in order to appear unattractive to men, was real. But now, a final piece of evidence confirms the whole thing was a hoax.

WTSP has uncovered a stolen luggage report from the Tampa International Airport that lists a ""3 breast prosthesis"" as part of the baggage. The report was filed by Alisha Hessler, a Tampa-area massage therapist, whom Snopes fingered as the evil genius behind the Tridevil persona.

This is Hessler's second run-in with viral fame: Back in December 2013, she made a man wear a dunce cap and a sign that says ""I beat women"" on a busy street corner after he reportedly beat her up. Hessler never followed up with police following the incident.

Sorry, dudes: It appears your Total Recall sex fantasies have been temporarily sidelined."
Third boob likely a hoax,2486,agree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

"Woman pays $20,000 for third breast to make herself LESS attractive to men",157,disagree,"The woman claiming to have 3 boobs is A FRAUD ... A FAKE ... and ironically what exposed her lie is a crime someone committed against her.

Jasmine Tridevil has been making the rounds, claiming she got plastic surgery to netted her an additional boob.

But we got a document from the Tampa International Airport Police Dept. describing a baggage theft. According to the doc ... someone stole a bunch of luggage off an American Airlines conveyor belt, including a black nylon roller bag.

Cops caught the thieves after IDing them with surveillance video.   The black bag belonged to Tridevel, but before she got it back it was inventoried by police as part of the case against the crooks.

Guess what was inside the bag?  ""A 3 breast prosthesis.""

BTW ... she told cops the prosthesis was valued at $5K.

‘Crabzilla’ a 50-foot colossal conundrum,1902,discuss,"A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax.

Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour.

But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big.

This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast

The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax

Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant ""crabzilla"" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax.

'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.'

She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo.

'Crabs with a ""pie crust edge"", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.'

Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged

The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs, which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep

Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long

Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore.

'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.'

The photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called Weird Whistable, a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

The image has sparked a rash of less believable online images, with Twitter users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water."
‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,2023,discuss,"Debate is raging online as to whether pic shows super-sized snapper of the Kent coast could be the biggest ever to grace UK shores

Is this Britain's biggest crab caught on camera?

The shock snap clicked from the air has caused a stir online, with many convinced it shows a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

But others claim the photo is fishy - and is nothing more than a oddly-shaped sandbank or a a bit of image manipulation.

The 'super crab' picture shows the harbour at Whitstable, Kent. And the unexplained 'creature of the deep' dwarfs fishing boats left on the nearby pier

The pic appeared on the website Weird Whitstable - a collection of the strange put together by Quinton Winter.

Weird Whitstable   Claws for concern: Is this picture shared on the internet the biggest crab the banks of Britain have ever seen?

He told the Daily Express that he saw the mega-crab last summer.

Quinton said: ""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood'.

""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

""Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

The world's largest recorded crab is the Japanese spider crab, a species which can grow to around 12ft and weigh up to three stone.

Woman with three breasts: Real or hoax?,2270,discuss,"After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil, 21, of Tampa had allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself ""unattractive to men,"" we've heard whispers in the wind (and read stories) that this Third Boob is a stunt, a hoax. It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...

Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as ""FALSE,"" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page, Tridevil's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body.

Trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night, where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another, longer look, Tridevil declined, telling the reporter, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Yes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.

Last year, Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading ""I BEAT WOMEN, HONK IF I'M A SCUMBAG"" in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident, but she apparently refused all the calls.

And in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.

Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:

This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.

And Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, ""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.""

So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the ""truth."" But the truth is, we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.

Triple-breasted woman pictured before 'operation' and vows surgery footage will prove third boob is no hoax,2392,disagree,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
Third boob likely a hoax,1128,disagree,"A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she said.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad ... he really isn’t happy ... he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticised Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci fi film Total Recall.

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like ... we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,561,discuss,"Tampa, Fla. (CBS TAMPA) – A Tampa massage therapist who calls herself “Jasmine Tridevil” says she spent $20,000 on a procedure to add a third breast to her chest.

The 21-year-old says she saved up for two years for the surgery that she hopes will land her a reality television show on MTV. Tridevil says it’s not just fame and fortune that pushed her to have the surgery – it was also a desire to rebuff men
“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she told Real Radio. “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore… Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”
“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”
Last month, she uploaded a YouTube video of herself modeling in a bikini as Radiohead’s “Creep” plays in the background.
Her “Jasmine Tridevil” social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram have received reactions of disbelief – and support — at her selfie photographs featuring her in bikinis and other outfits displaying her third breast. She said she made many of her own outfits for herself.
Tridevil received the surgery a few months prior, although “it was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.
Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.
Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.
“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"

Sisi denies claims over providing Palestinians with Sinai lands,2462,disagree,"Egyptian President General Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has offered Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas the chance to create a Palestinian state in the Sinai Peninsula, according to local Israeli media.

The offer to the Palestinian President which, reports say Abbas has denied, would have seen 1,600 square kilometres of the Sinai Peninsula given to the Palestinian Authority, creating a Palestinian state five times the size of Gaza.

According to IDF Radio, the offer would see Abbas relinquish demands that Israel return to the 1967 borders.

In the new and enlarged Gaza, the territory would be demilitarised and Palestinian refugees, many who were unable to return to their towns after the creation of Israel, would have been able to settle there.

As part of the proposal, Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank would have been autonomous and continued to be under Palestinian Authority control.

Sisi allegedly said to Abbas in the meeting: ""You are now 80 years old, if you don't accept this proposal, your successor will.""

The Palestinian Authority is yet to publicly comment on the initiative but unnamed sources said that Abbas rejected the deal in a meeting with Sisi.

The Israeli military radio station said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had knowledge of the offer and that the United States had given its approval to such an idea.

An idea along the same lines was introduced years ago by Israeli academics but Egypt rejected the proposal.

Elsewhere, the future of a unity government between Abbas' Fatah and Hamas remains uncertain after the Palestinian president voiced his displeasure at the Islamist group's ""shadow"" leadership of Gaza.

""We cannot continue working with Hamas this way. There are 27 undersecretaries of ministries who are running the Gaza Strip, and the national unity government cannot do anything on the ground.

""We won't accept the continuation of the situation with Hamas as it is now and in this shape,"" he said. ""There must be one authority and one regime.""

Gaza is still recovering from a 50-day conflict which saw more than 2,100 Palestinians killed as well as 66 Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli civilians.

Stop Sharing Those Photos of Fancy International School Lunches,1191,disagree,"Since the program’s inception, Michelle Obama’s Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act has offended the sensibilities of the entire nation.

Conservatives found the program to be invasive, thrusting D.C.’s hand into local education matters. Educators found the program wasted enormous amounts of food and money. Parents found the lunches far too light to be considered “meals.” And school children everywhere took to the Internet with pictures of the gruesome dishes the program sloshed onto their cafeteria trays every day.

Those pictures did massive amounts of damage to Michelle’s pet program, but now an even worse PR disaster rears its head. This week the U.K. Daily Mail ran pictures of what other countries feed their school children. The comparison is stark … and humiliating for the United States.

The “meal” above featuring an orange slice, a puddle of either apple sauce or a pulverized slice of peach or pear, and what looks like lumpy chipped beef without the toast is one of the dishes that complies with Michelle’s totalitarian program.

Compare this insult to parents, palettes and taxpayers alike with what other nations feed their school children. The contrast below is striking to say the least.

There you have it. Those are samples from a bankrupt Mediterranean nation, a former second-world nation, a financially stricken European nation, a favela-ridden South American nation and some of our other allies.

Every single one manages to feed their schoolchildren in a more thorough, appetizing and seemingly humane way than the world’s lone remaining superpower (H/T U.K. Daily Mail).

What Michelle Obama has done to our children’s food is a national disgrace, and she should hang her head in shame.

Please like and share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you agree that Michelle Obama and her husband are both national disgraces."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

UK looking into reports IS beheading suspect wounded,351,discuss,"London (AFP) - The British government on Saturday said it had received reports that ""Jihadi John"", the British-accented Islamic State militant apparently responsible for the beheading of western hostages, had been injured in a US air strike.

The Foreign Office could not confirm reports published in the Mail on Sunday that the masked executioner, who has appeared in a series of grisly videos posted online, had been wounded while attending a meeting of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last week.

According to the paper, he was rushed to hospital following the US-led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim, western Iraq, on Saturday that killed around 10 IS commanders and wounded 40 more.

The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, sparking initial rumours that he had been killed.

""Jihadi John"", named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background, is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Allan Henning.

Despite being a foreigner, the masked assassin, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, has become a leading figure in the Islamist group that swept across Syria and northern Iraq.

The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list, referring to him as ""the one who slaughtered the journalists"".

The wounded men were then driven to the IS's Syrian stronghold of Raqa, according to the Mail's source.

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 home-grown militants fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq, and Prime Minister David Cameron this week announced plans to stop them returning to Britain for two years."
"Woman Gets Third Boob Implanted, Wants to Be ""Unattractive to Men""",2486,disagree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,1309,discuss,"The United States government said early Wednesday that the video showing the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff at the hands of an Islamic State militant is authentic.

According to the Twitter page run by President Barack Obama's National Security Council:

The US Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing US citizen Steven Sotloff & reached judgment it is authentic.

— @NSCPress (@NSCPress) September 3, 2014

The video, which was discovered on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, showed Sotloff being beheaded in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to the slaying, Sotloff was shown kneeling on the ground and wearing orange clothing, a scene that was reminiscent of the Islamic State murder of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

The masked militant on the video warned President Barack Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, ""our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" He also threatened the life of David Haines, a British citizen and aid worker, who was kidnapped in March 2013.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelancer for Time magazine and Foreign Policy, was abducted in 2013 while covering the civil war in Syria.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Sotloff's murder a ""despicable crime,"" the BBC News reported.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement Wednesday, calling the killing of Sotloff ""unfathomable"" and ""an act of medieval savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.""

""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took,"" he said. ""And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.""

Islamic militants are believed to be holding several more journalists in captivity, most of them Syrian reporters."
‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,2245,disagree,"A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent, UK, is proving a great drawcard… for the website that’s claiming it’s a giant crab.

Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UK’s weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it.

But even he couldn’t believe this aerial photograph of a 50-foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour:


Crab, sandbank, or Photoshopping idiot? Picture: Weird Whitstable
So he went to check it out for himself.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’,” Winter said.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

HP is reportedly splitting into two companies,1994,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +6.68%  on Monday said it plans to separate its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, the latest attempt by the technology company to improve its fortunes by breaking itself in two.

The company will make the split through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders by the end of fiscal 2015.

If the division goes off as planned, it would give rise to two publicly traded companies, each with more than $50 billion in annual revenue.

H-P also boosted the number of its expected layoffs by 5,000 to 55,000, after identifying “incremental opportunities for reductions.” H-P had previously projected its job cuts to be between 45,000 and 50,000, and it has already shed 36,000 employees under the restructuring program as of the end of the most recent quarter.

A number of big companies, including eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  in tech, have chosen to break up lately, in part because of a belief that operations with different growth profiles are best managed as separate entities. H-P, which has suffered sharp sales declines, sees better long-term potential for its corporate hardware and services business than for its printer and PC unit, said one person familiar with the plan.

The impending move, first reported Sunday by The Wall Street Journal, set off a round of speculation in the industry about whether the separation could lead to more deal making.

The Journal recently reported that for much of the past year, H-P held talks to merge with data-storage equipment maker EMC Corp. EMC +0.49%  , a deal that would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion. Although the talks recently ended, the separation could pave the way for H-P’s corporate hardware and services business to ultimately be combined with EMC, industry observers said.

The planned breakup is one that Palo Alto, Calif.-based H-P and its investors have long contemplated. H-P came close to hiving off its PC operation in 2011, when it announced the ill-fated acquisition of U.K. software company Autonomy Corp. H-P said then it was exploring a separation of its PC business, only to decide two months later to hold on to it amid pressure from shareholders, which led to the departure of then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker.

H-P in 1999 spun off Agilent Technologies, A +1.93%  a maker of electronic-testing gear and other hardware. Agilent subsequently announced plans to break itself up.


H-P chief Meg Whitman is slated to be chairman of a PC and printer business, while remaining CEO of a separate company selling corporate hardware and services. Associated Press
In 2012, under current H-P Chief Executive Meg Whitman, the company reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation, helping pave the way for the current plan.

Ms. Whitman is slated to be chairman of the PC and printer business, to be known as HP Inc., and CEO of the other company, to be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Current lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business.

H-P, which affirmed its guidance for the year ending Oct. 31, said it expects per-share earnings of $3.83 to $4.03 for fiscal 2015. The range doesn’t include one-time charges expected to be connected to the separation. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting $3.95 a share.

In the 2013 fiscal year ended last October, the Printing and Personal Systems Group, as it is known, reported $55.9 billion in revenue, about half of H-P’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for company revenue as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK +0.68%  , according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since the beginning of last year, but they remain well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached during the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% on Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

In response to lower sales and to provide a lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as “cloud” software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

The recent wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world has been fueled by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—and sometimes actively sought by them.

Last Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay, where Ms. Whitman was once CEO, announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

This Third Boob Is Probably Only Real in Our Hearts,2292,disagree,"A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

Parents say they were kept in the dark on attempts to save James Foley,1729,discuss,"The families of murdered American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff are speaking out against the US government for making their efforts to free their loved ones a ""helpless"" endeavor.

The parents of Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who was kidnapped by militants in Syria, told Yahoo News on Friday that a member of the president's National Security Council threatened them with criminal prosecution if they attempted to pay a ransom to get their son freed.

""The family felt completely and utterly helpless when they heard this,"" Barak Barfi, a friend of Sotloff who is serving as a spokesman for his family, told Yahoo News. ""The Sotloffs felt there was nothing they could do to get Steve out.""

Sotloff's mother, Shirley, recorded an emotional video directly addressing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in late August. Despite her plea for mercy, the group murdered her son one week later.

The claim that the government would bring charges against the Sotloff family echoes similar points made in a CNN interview with Jim Foley's mother Diane, in which she said she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by the US government's handling of her son's case.

In the interview, Diane Foley listed things the US government advised the family not to do, including not going to the media and not to raise a ransom since it would be illegal — ""we might be prosecuted,"" Foley said she was told. She also says the government told her it would not exchange prisoners or conduct a military action to go after him.

""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" she said. ""And he wasn't, was he?""

Jim Foley, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost in Syria, was brutally murdered in mid-August soon after the US began airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq.

""It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted ... "" Diane Foley told ABC News. ""I’m sure [the US official] didn’t mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing … meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.”

The US military attempted a rescue operation in July to find Foley, Sotloff, and other hostages believed to be held near ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, although the special operations troops were unable to locate any of them. The Wall Street Journal reported the hostages were likely moved as little as 72 hours prior to the raid."
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,746,discuss,"You won’t believe this one.

According to Buzzfeed, a young woman from Tampa, Fla., has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on “Inside Edition” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But so far at least that part of her story isn't panning out.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, wrote on Facebook: “So I'm flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

But Kimmel is famous for online pranks, including a viral video called ""Worst twerk fail EVER,"" purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident, that turned out to be staged by his show.

HEALTH: Purported third-breast add raises medical, ethical questions

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.

Well, she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another ""Total Recall"" remake.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...

Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as ""FALSE,"" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable.

Yes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.

And in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.

Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:

This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.

And Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, ""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.""

So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the ""truth."" But the truth is, we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,697,disagree,"If you've been anywhere even remotely near a computer today, you've probably heard that Argentina's president recently adopted a young Jewish man to stop him from turning into a werewolf. And why not—it's internet gold! Also, as it turns out, not even remotely true.

According to the Washington Post, the story of the day is as follows:

A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form, feeding on the dead and murdering all before it.... The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.
While, yes, seventh sons and daughters in Argentina are eligible to become the godson or goddaughter (read: not the adopted child) of the country's president, as The Guardian points out, Jewish werewolf-hood has no part in the tradition. Which is fairly evident from Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's tweets depicting the country's newly announced first Jewish godson.

Top translation: They brought me a menorah. They asked me to light it. Bottom translation: I didn't realize it, but their visit coincided with Hanukkah.

But, as The Guardian points out, this nice, totally innocuous event somehow got mixed up with an ancient, werewolf-esque myth called the lobizón:

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón(Argentina's equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colorful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behavior from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

In fact, the only connection between the two tales is that they center around seventh children. There is an actual, century-old tradition in which every seventh child born to an Argentinian family is eligible to become the president's godchild—a practice originating from Czarist Russia. The tale of the lobizón, on the other hand, started amongst Argentina's gauchos and has nothing whatsoever to do with the president's newly minted godson.

So sorry to burst your bubble, internet—no werewolf Jewish godsons this time. But hey, at least it got us talking about this again. [The Guardian]

Florida woman gets third breast surgically implanted,1286,discuss,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Parent: Fourth-grader suspended after using magic from 'The Hobbit',910,discuss,"The ring little Aiden brought to school may not have been the true ring of power, but it had enough controversy to get him suspended from a Kermit, Texas, school.

Tolkien lore led a Texas boy to suspension after he brought his “one ring” to school.

Kermit Elementary School officials called it a threat when the 9-year-old boy, Aiden Steward, in a playful act of make-believe, told a classmate he could make him disappear with a ring forged in fictional Middle Earth’s Mount Doom.

“It sounded unbelievable,” the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the Daily News. He insists his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”

The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies” days earlier, inspiring Aiden’s imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all.

“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Steward said.

Aiden claimed Thursday he could put a ring on his friend's head and make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins, who stole Gollum’s ""precious"" in J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings.”

“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” the boy's father later wrote in an email. ""If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.""

Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the fourth-grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, who first reported Aiden’s troubles Friday.

The family moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, but it’s been nothing but headaches for Aiden. He’s already been suspended three times this school year.

Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as black and bringing his favorite book to school: ""The Big Book of Knowledge.""

“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Steward said.

But the teacher learned the popular children’s encyclopedia had a section on pregnancy, depicting a pregnant woman in an illustration, he explained.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,897,disagree,"So here's the latest in wild internet rumors.

Everyone thinks that the President of Argentina Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a young Jewish man in order to stop him from turning into a werewolf. The story was reported by The Independent and others.

Well, the story's kind of true — Fernández de Kirchner did adopt the young man as her godson — but not to keep him from turning into a werewolf.

There's an old Argentinian legend that a seventh child will turn into ""el lobizon"" — aka a werewolf — after his 13th birthday, and then terrorize the Argentinian countryside at night whenever there's a full moon, as reported by the Independent. In the 19th century, parents were reportedly so spooked by ""el lobizon"" that they started abandoning and murdering their 7th children.

Around the same time, in the early 20th century, another tradition involving a seventh child came to be. Argentinian presidents started adopting the seventh child born in a family as godchildren.

Mágico fue recibir a Iair Tawil, 1er ahijado presidencial de nuestra historia que profesa la fe judía. pic.twitter.com/18eNPR5kXv

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

Over the last few days, sources have been reporting that this Argentinian custom was adopted as a response to the murder and abandonment of these ""el lobizon"" children.

However, others like the Guardian are debunking this. Reportedly, the godchild custom goes back all the way to 1907 when Russian emigrés asked the then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become the godfather to their seventh son, reports the Guardian.

""The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,"" Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told The Guardian.

So what exactly what special about Iair Tawil's case? Traditionally, the seventh son or daughter could only become a godchild of the Argentinian president if he or she was Christian. But Tawil was the first Jewish young man to do so — making it a tweet-worthy affair.

Fernández has become the president godmother to roughly 700 children since she took office in 2007, reports The Guardian.

The man told rescuers he was sure it was dead. He has no explanation for what happened. When they found Bart alive, they rushed it to the hospital.

Bart is at the Human Society of Tampa Bay right now, and rescuers told FOX 13 that he has severe trauma to the head, a broken jaw, a dead eye, and other injuries. Right now, doctors are scheduling surgery to save its life.

FOX 13 visited Bart on Monday. Rescuers say they believe he may have regained consciousness, dug himself out of the ground, and hid for a few days.

They say he's likely to live, but he will lose his eye.

Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,1924,disagree,"A Florida massage therapist said she paid $20,000 for a third breast in hopes of becoming less attractive to men

""I don't want to date anymore,"" Jasmine Tridevil told Orlando's Real Radio 104.1.

Tridevil, 21, has documented her post-surgery life through photos and videos posted to YouTube, Facebook and other social media sites -- mostly images of her posing in custom-made three-cup bikinis and bras.

Her desire to repel the opposite sex with her updated anatomy wasn't her only motivation for the surgery: Tridevil also hopes to have her own show on MTV someday.

She said she contacted more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to perform the operation."
Woman Who Claimed To Have Surgery To Add Third Breast Exposed As Hoaxer,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,1031,discuss,"e Islamic State militant group released a video today purporting to show the beheading of U.S. hostage Steven J. Sotloff.

A masked figure in the video also issued a threat against a British hostage, a man the group named as David Haines, and warned governments to back off ""this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State"", the SITE Intelligence Group monitoring service said.

Sotloff, a freelance journalist, was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. Sotloff's mother Shirley appealed on Aug. 27 in a videotaped message to Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, for her son's release.

The White House said it could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing that if there is such a video, it would be analyzed very carefully, adding that the administration's thoughts and prayers were with Sotloff's family.

Shortly before the briefing, the SITE monitoring service said the militant group had released the video.

On Aug. 19 the group published a video showing the beheading of U.S. hostage James Foley, a Marquette and Northwestern alum. The group said his death was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes on fighters in Iraq.

That video was issued after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq in August for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011.

After Islamic State's beheading of journalist James Foley, President Barack Obama's administration is making little headway in efforts to secure the release of other Americans held by the insurgent group in Syria, officials said.

The U.S. government has said it does not pay ransoms or negotiate with the Islamic State.

Washington has contacted about two dozen countries for help in freeing the three, but no foreign government appears to have influence over or even significant contact with IS, which has declared an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.

""What we've found is that ISIS isn't responsive"" to outreach, said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity and using an alternate acronym for the group.

Another administration official said Washington was working with other Western countries whose citizens are being held hostage, and with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and others in the region thought by the United States to possibly have influence with the groups Al-Nusrah and IS.

The hostages' fate received little public attention until Islamic State posted an online video on Aug. 19 showing Foley's beheading. It now presents a frustrating challenge for Obama.

Islamic State ""is far more difficult to deal with"" than Iran or the militant group Hezbollah, which also took Americans captive, said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA and White House official now at the Brookings Institution think-tank. The group ""wants to terrorize Americans, it's not really interested in deals.""

WHITE HOUSE INVOLVEMENT
U.S. officials and supporters of the remaining hostages requested that most details about them and efforts to free them be withheld.

One of the other U.S. hostages is a female aid worker, age 26, for whom Islamic State has demanded $6.6 million in ransom, according to ABC News.

Lisa Monaco, Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser, has been ""very deeply involved in this,"" the senior U.S. official said. Monaco, along with the State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, has been in contact with hostages' families, the official said.

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said, "" The Administration has had regular interactions with the families of those Americans who have been held hostage in Syria since the kidnapping of their loved ones. These interactions included representatives from all the relevant agencies, including the Department of State, the FBI, the Intelligence Community, and the White House.""

Obama authorized a covert raid in Syria in July to rescue Foley and other American hostages, but they were not at the site where they were thought to be held. Another rescue attempt would be risky for U.S. special forces and the hostages.

The American diplomatic effort also is aimed at persuading European countries not to pay ransoms, officials said.


U.S. and European officials have said that France, Spain and Italy have tolerated or facilitated ransom payments for citizens held in Syria. Islamic State released numerous European journalists this year, including two Spaniards in March and four Frenchmen in April.

The French government has denied a news report that it paid a ransom to free the four. Spain's foreign ministry has not commented on the matter.

The U.S. policy of refusing to pay ransoms to discourage further hostage-taking ""is as close as we are likely to come to governments influencing ISIS on the matter of seizing hostages"", said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA analyst now at Georgetown University.

U.S. officials have said that Qatar played a critical role in persuading a rival group in Syria, the official al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, to free American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, whom it had been holding since 2012.

Qatar is working to help free other Americans held captive in Syria, a Gulf source told Reuters, but U.S. officials said the Qatari government has little if any leverage with Islamic State.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,561,discuss,"Tampa, Fla. (CBS TAMPA) – A Tampa massage therapist who calls herself “Jasmine Tridevil” says she spent $20,000 on a procedure to add a third breast to her chest.
The Florida woman told a Florida radio station that she “called like 50 or 60 doctors” in order to have the surgery adding a third breast. The 21-year-old says she saved up for two years for the surgery that she hopes will land her a reality television show on MTV. Tridevil says it’s not just fame and fortune that pushed her to have the surgery – it was also a desire to rebuff men
“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she told Real Radio. “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore… Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”
“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”
Last month, she uploaded a YouTube video of herself modeling in a bikini as Radiohead’s “Creep” plays in the background.
Her “Jasmine Tridevil” social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram have received reactions of disbelief – and support — at her selfie photographs featuring her in bikinis and other outfits displaying her third breast. She said she made many of her own outfits for herself.
Tridevil received the surgery a few months prior, although “it was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.
Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.
Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.
“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

Parent: Fourth-grader suspended after using magic from 'The Hobbit',1111,discuss,"An elementary school suspended a boy who arrived at school last week with what he alleged was a powerful ring that appears in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy books.

Aiden Steward was suspended from Kermit Elementary School in Kermit, Texas, over a Thursday incident, The New York Daily News reported.

While speaking to another boy, 9-year-old Steward said he would able to use the One Ring and turn the fellow student invisible, according to the newspaper.

Powerful: Aiden Steward was suspended from school after telling a boy he had the One Ring and could make a student become invisible, like in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books

Speaking to The New York Daily News, father Jason Steward said 'It sounded unbelievable.'

The One Ring, as it is known, features in both Tolkien's prequel 'The Hobbit' as well as 'The Lord of the Rings.' At various points in the books, characters Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins put on the ring to make it seem as if they have vanished into thin air.

'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy follows a group of characters that set to destroy the One Ring, since it can also be used to control other peoples and kingdoms.

Steward told The New York Daily News 'Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly.'

The newspaper reported that the Steward family recently viewed 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.' Peter Jackson directed film adaptations for both 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.'

Magical: Bilbo Baggins (portrayed here by Martin Freeman) is able to get his hands on the One Ring after an encounter with the creature Gollum

Scene: The incident took place at Kermit Elementary School, pictured

Jason Steward told the newspaper 'I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence. If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.'

Speaking to The Odessa American, he said the school considered his son's behavior to be a threat.

Principal Roxanne Greer did not comment to the website, and said 'All student stuff is confidential.'

The website reported 'The 9-year-old has been in in-school suspension for referring to another student’s skin color and got in trouble for bringing a kids’ book about pregnancy to school.'

Greer and Kermit Independent School District Superintendent Bill Boyd did not immediately return messages seeking comment from Daily Mail Online."
'Crabzilla' or 'Crapzilla' -- You Decide,2146,discuss,"Nowadays, it seems the world is just littered with crises. But one thing we don't have to worry about is ""Crabzilla.""

A photo depicting what appears to be a 50-foot crab hanging out near a wharf in Kent, England, started making the rounds on the Internet earlier this week. The photo was featured on a local curiosities site called Weird Whitstable, and eventually dubbed ""Crabzilla.""

Quinton Winter, who runs the site, told the Daily Express that he'd spotted a giant crab in the mouth of Kent harbor while on vacation with his son last year. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws,"" he said.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbor reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?"" Winter asks on his website.

Experts say neither.

""The idea of a giant 'crabzilla' would [be] very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax,"" Dr. Verity Nye, Ocean and Earth Science researcher at Southampton University, told the Daily Mail. ""I don't know what the currents are like around that harbor or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.""

Spider crabs, the largest known to British waters, grow to about 4 feet and inhabit much deeper waters than the those near the pier where Crabzilla is shown lurking.

Saudi Arabia May Be Taking Misogyny to the Skies,1445,discuss,"Saudi Arabia’s national airline carrier is planning to introduce gender segregation aboard its flights following complaints from passengers who refused to have random males seated next to their wives, the Kingdom’s media report.

Airline company Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women separated onboard, unless they are close relatives, the Emirates247 news website reported.

“There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, according to Saudi daily Ajel.


Saudia's traveling policies are already in accord with the strict Islam practices of Saudi Arabia. For instance, in addition to the routine boarding announcements at the Kingdom’s airports, a prayer or verse from the Quran is read prior to take off. Furthermore, international flights usually have a specially designated men’s prayer area to accommodate 5 daily prayers. In addition, the airline does not offer any beverages or dishes which contain alcohol or pork products. And the onboard entertainment menu does not offer any movies with adult content.


The Kingdom itself is infamous for gender segregation in everyday matters of society. For instance, women typically require male guardian approval to travel or work outside of the home. Saudi women are also not employed as stewardesses on Saudi Arabia’s national carrier. That role is reserved for women of other nationalities.

Ironically enough, Israel too is battling the same problem, as many ultra-orthodox Jews refuse to share their transit time with female companions. A flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed by half an hour in late December after a group of male Jewish passengers onboard a Delta flight refused to sit next to women.


In October, on the eve of the Jewish festival Rosh Hashana, ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men left the plane before take-off, also between New York and Tel Aviv, again refusing to sit next to women. In an incident in September, Israeli carrier El Al flight was postponed by 11-hours after a group of Haredi passengers refused to sit next to women.

Last September an Israeli campaign, seeking to put a stop to the segregation stalemate started an online campaign on Change.org, entitled, ""Ultra-Orthodox passengers refuse to sit next to women on El Al flights""

""Why does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines? One person's religious rights does not trump another person's civil rights,"" the petition said."
Triple-breasted woman pictured before 'operation' and vows surgery footage will prove third boob is no hoax,2183,discuss,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

While another commented, “you’re stupid for doing this. There are other ways to become famous.”

Third boob likely a hoax,1741,discuss,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."

Hewlett Packard ‘planning to split into two’,1643,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman reportedly plans to split the company in two, becoming chair of a new company with its PC and printer business and CEO of a new company with its corporate hardware and services businesses.

Hewlett-Packard plans to break into two companies in a move that would create separate personal computer/printer and corporate hardware/services businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

The report cited unnamed sources who said the plan could be announced as early as Monday.

The split would be done as a tax-free distribution of stock to shareholders next year, one of the Journal's sources said.

It would be the second big breakup of a Silicon Valley tech powerhouse in a week, following eBay's plan to spin off PayPal. It also comes in the wake of Oracle's announcement that Larry Ellison was handing the CEO reins over to former HP CEO Mark Hurd and Safra Catz.

The move by HP has long been speculated upon and follows the 2011 exploration of a spinoff of the PC business during Leo Apotheker's stormy and short tenure as CEO.

Current CEO Meg Whitman reorganized the company to combine the PC and printer units, which are leaders in shrinking businesses. HP was No. 1 in PCs until last year when it slipped behind China's Lenovo Group Ltd.

The Journal said that Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the other enterprise-focused business. Lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company. Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation will be CEO of that business.

HP brought in $55.9 billion in revenue from its printing and personal systems group last year, about half of its total. But sales dropped by about 7.1 percent in the unit, compared to a 6.7 percent drop for the company as a whole."
Stolen Member,1160,discuss,"Police in Niqiao village, a small region near Wenling City in east China's Zhejiang province report that a local man's penis was stolen by thieves while he slept, according to a report by the UK's British Star later picked up by the Huffington Post.

""I was so shocked I didn't feel a thing—then I saw I was bleeding and my penis was gone.""

While nobody has been apprehended yet, a report in the Austrian Times states that police believe the assailants were jealous or slighted lovers of several local women whom Lin was involved in romantically or sexually. Lin, for his part, denied taking part in any infidelity.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,861,agree,"The president of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish grandson in order to prevent him becoming a werewolf.

Hmmm, let us explain.

According to an old Argentinian legend, the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between is liable to turn into one of the mythical creatures.

Fear was so rife in the country that families would often give up their seventh-born sons for adoption or even kill them.

In the 1920s a law was passed to counteract the legend. It offered presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday but only for Catholic families.

US denies it threatened Foley family,2195,agree,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is denying claims that the administration threatened legal action against the families of kidnapped Americans if they paid ransom to their captors, the Islamic State.

McDonough hit a series of Sunday interview shows to promote the administration's counterterrorism plan against the Islamic State, including a plea to Congress to fund anti-Islamic State forces in Syria.

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff — American journalists beheaded by the Islamic State — said the government objected when they considered ransom payments, and even threatened prosecution.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. ""That's our responsibility, to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Ransom payments are prohibited under U.S. law, on the theory they would encourage terrorist groups to kidnap more Americans.

McDonough said he sympathized with the Foley and Sotloff families, and noted that the administration attempted a hostage rescue in Syria.

""We took every effort — and will continue to take every effort — to secure people,"" he said.

In discussing the counter-terrorism plan, McDonough urged Congress to fund anti-Islamic State fighters in Syria, and said the U.S. is ""obviously"" at war with the militant group.

The interviews aired a day after the Islamic State beheaded a third hostage, British aid worker David Haines

The plan that Obama announced Wednesday includes the prospect of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, while expanding ongoing strikes in neighboring Iraq.

Obama, McDonough, and other aides say the plan features assistance to local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS.

In his round of interviews, McDonough echoed Obama's pledge to avoid using U.S. combat troops, and to rely on forces in Syria and Iraq.

""That's why the Syrian opposition is so important,"" McDonough said on CNN's State of the Union, later adding that ""it's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL.""

On ABC's This Week, McDonough said that ""what we want to make sure happens is that we have committed partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. And they will have not only support from us from the air, but they'll also have training and equipment support from us.""

Lawmakers and analysts have questioned Obama's plan, saying that the United States will have to get more involved — including the prospect of ground troops — if the Islamic State is to be defeated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration is ""delusional"" about its plan.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said. ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion ... It's about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army — they're intending to come here.""

Graham also said of Obama: ""This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home.""

Administration officials have offered different descriptions of the administrations's plan, ranging from ""counter-terrorism operations"" to outright ""war.""

On NBC's Meet The Press, McDonough said that ""as much as we've been at war with al Qaeda since we got here, we're at war with ISIL.""

This Campaign Shows A Pretty Genius Way To Stop Men Catcalling In The Street,1716,agree,"A Peruvian public service announcement making the rounds today captured two men sexually harassing women on the street, only to find out that the victims of their catcalling are their own moms in disguise. Some sites are treating it as if a prankster's hidden camera actually caught a man hollering at his mom's ""tasty panties,"" but if the scene seems totally staged, that's because it was.

The ""Whistling at Your Mom"" ad actually debuted in Peru back in November, on the heels of the viral ""10 Hours Walking as a Woman in New York City"" that made street harassment a worldwide hot topic. The original Spanish-language video has been viewed more than 5 million times. A reuploaded, translated version hit Reddit this week, bringing the PSA to English-speaking audiences.

When the video first debuted, Spanish newspaper El País reported that the whole scene was staged with actors, but the story was ""based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed female relatives by mistake and expressed 'deep shame.'""

According to internet hoax-busting compendium Emergent.info, Peruvian business newspaper Gestion also called the video out as a scripted setup, writing, ""Speaking about the narrative aspect, it is obvious the situations had been staged. We do understand it would be difficult to go with real interactions, but it is also obvious they wanted us to believe they were real, when they're not.""

It's basically a funnier, tamer version of the hoax video from last November that showed men on Hollywood Boulevard trying to take advantage of a ""drunk"" woman. At least the actors knew what they were getting into in this one.

Although these gullible harassers didn't actually have the tables turned on them by their own moms—""tasty panties,"" god, how embarrassing—the point of the video still stands: Would you treat your mother like that?

The debate about whether setups like this do more harm than good in attempting to end catcalling—some people use them to disingenuously argue that street harassment itself is a fiction—continues."
Kid Suspended For Allegedly Threatening Classmate With ‘Hobbit’ Magic,1199,discuss,"A Grade 4 student was reportedly suspended from his Texas school after he threatened to make another boy disappear with his Lord of the Rings replica ring.

Jason Steward told the Odessa American that his son had seen The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies last weekend and got himself a replica of fabled One Ring.

Steward said his son wore it to Kermit Elementary School, where he told another boy the ring's magic could make him disappear.

Steward said the principal told him no threats would be tolerated — even magical ones.

The school wouldn't comment on the suspension, citing privacy concerns.

The boy has been in trouble before, his father said — once for referring to another child's skin colour, and once for bringing a children's book to school that had a chapter about pregnancy.

But the dad assured the New York Daily News the nine-year-old Tolkien enthusiast is not dangerous.

""I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend's existence,"" he said."
Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,1102,agree,"Argentina’s president has accepted an official Jewish godson for the first time in the country’s history.

President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.

He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend, the seventh son, born after six boys without any girls in-between, becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf.

The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.

The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009, which allows children from other religions to qualify.

The boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday.

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree, and asking for the designation of godson.

Yair Tawil on Tuesday became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received the Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together on a Hanukkah menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers the “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”

She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

Shlomo Tawil is the director of the Chabad House in Rosaria, located in central Argentina."

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2323,discuss,"Details surrounding the death of comedian Joan Rivers keep getting more and more suspect.

First there was the report that her personal doctor, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, performed a biopsy on her vocal cords, a procedure experts say should have been performed at a hospital, not an outpatient surgery center such as Yorkville Endoscopy. Rivers reportedly did not consent to the biopsy.

Then it was revealed the clinic doctor who performed Rivers’s endoscopy, gastroenterologist Lawrence Cohen, no longer works for Yorkville. There have been conflicting reports about whether he resigned or was fired. A spokesman for the clinic told The Wrap: “Dr. Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy, nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

And now, an unnamed source claims Rivers’s personal doctor took a selfie while she was under general anesthesia, according to a report by CNN. Rivers’s doctor remains unnamed, and the alleged selfie has not yet surfaced in news reports.

Rivers entered Yorkville Endoscopy in New York City on Aug. 28 for a procedure to determine why she was hoarse and her throat was sore. She stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy and went into cardiac arrest. Rivers was put in a medically induced coma and died at Mount Sinai hospital on Sept. 4 at age 81. Initial autopsy results from the New York Medical Examiner’s Office were deemed inconclusive."
Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,1902,agree,"A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax.

Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour.

But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big.

This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast

The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax

Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant ""crabzilla"" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax.

'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.'

She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo.

'Crabs with a ""pie crust edge"", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.'

Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged

The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs, which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep

Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long

Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore.

'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.'

The photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called Weird Whistable, a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

The image has sparked a rash of less believable online images, with Twitter users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water."
‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,733,discuss,"THIS seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain’s biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 15-metres wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of ‘Crabzilla’, others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank — or is simply a playful hoax.

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour — dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable — an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image — sent to him by a follower — showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

He said: ‘At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, “that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood”.

‘It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

‘Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.’

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 3.5-metres. So we’re betting this ‘15 metre crabzilla’ is the work of one very talented photoshopper!"
NEWS/ Viral Video: What Happens When You Accidentally Catcall Your Mom,261,discuss,"Well, this is about as shame-inducing as it gets.
A new viral video, produced by Everlast (yep, the boxing company), shows young men in Lima, Peru getting a big surprise during a catcall session. In a segment titled ""Harassing Your Mother,"" Everlast took a group of women and changed up their looks with makeup and wardrobe changes and then had them walk past their own sons. After the young men embarrassed themselves with offensive exclamations like ""tasty panties"" and ""Hello, piggy,"" the women revealed themselves.
NEWS: This woman turns catcalls she receives into embroideries
As you can imagine, the resulting confrontations showed the sons backpedaling on their catcalls and the mothers giving a piece of their mind.
Everlast put together this (possibly staged) spectacle to highlight the rampant sexual harassment in Peru—nearly seven in 10 women have been catcalled. Even if it's not the most realistic situation, it still does a great job of showing how uncomfortable a simple commute can be for Peruvian women. Here's hoping these brats learned a lesson."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,746,discuss,"You won’t believe this one.

According to Buzzfeed, a young woman from Tampa, Fla., has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on “Inside Edition” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But so far at least that part of her story isn't panning out.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, wrote on Facebook: “So I'm flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

But Kimmel is famous for online pranks, including a viral video called ""Worst twerk fail EVER,"" purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident, that turned out to be staged by his show.

HEALTH: Purported third-breast add raises medical, ethical questions

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.

Well, she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another ""Total Recall"" remake.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,2183,discuss,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

A picture posted by Jasmine. Photo: FACEBOOK

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

Fox Affiliate Falls for College Humor's Office Note War Prank,1005,disagree,"The stand-off between an office worker, known only as 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' and their colleague, 'Sandwich Thief' has become an internet hit

This office note battle between a cheeky sandwich thief and their jobsworth nemesis might just be the funniest thing you read all day.

If you've ever worked in an office, you'll be familiar with those who are possessive about their lunch and partial to a passive-aggressive note.

And if those people annoy you, this funny note war should give you a giggle.

The battle breaks out when someone has a sandwich stolen from the office fridge.

Clearly irked, they leave their light-fingered a note, telling them to stop stealing.

And the subsequent string of letters between the two doesn't disappoint.

Check out the hilarious exchanges between the two below.

A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself ""unatttractive to men.""

The admittedly ""crazy"" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore.

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,785,disagree,"She made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as Tampa Bay’s 10 News revealed Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three-breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on Sept. 16.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prosthesis.”

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumor site Snopes also discovered that her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone to whom Tridevil bears a striking resemblance.

However, when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be skeptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Photo: FaceookTridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 to 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for.”

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn agreed that while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely that anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip, Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple,” which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” on her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different … that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre-surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

It’s not the first time Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after he made unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges, she offered her attacker an ultimatum, telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women.’”

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
"50ft crustacean, dubbed Crabzilla, photographed lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable",998,discuss,"An astonishing image appears to show a giant crab, nearly 50 feet across, lurking in the harbor at Whitstable, Kent, and while some assert that it is a playful hoax, others believe they have found evidence of a genuine aquatic monster.

The aerial image reveals the outline of a crab at the mouth of Kent harbor, yet the size of the animal dwarfs fishing boats on a nearby pier, as the Daily Mail notes. The giant animal is shaped like an edible crab, a species commonly found in British waters, but which only grows to be ten inches across, on average.

People have flocked to the website Weird Whitstable since the image was first posted there, to judge its authenticity for themselves. Quinton Winter, who curates Weird Whitstable, asserted that the image of the giant crab was sent to him by a follower. At first, he believed that it showed only an unusually shaped sand formation, though he is now convinced that there truly is a strange animal lurking in the harbor.

While crabbing with his son in Whitstable harbor last year, Winter claims to have spotted the giant crab near shore, as he related to The Daily Express.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood,’ Winter said. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws… Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

In July of last year, another image emerged, depicting a giant crab lurking underneath a pier.

Another image, said to be taken in July of last year and posted on Winter’s Weird Whitstablog, purports to show a giant, albeit smaller, crab hiding under a pier.

“This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend,” claims Winter’s website, adding “The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

Graphic artist Ashley Austen noted his skepticism of the aerial image while speaking to Kent Online, describing the way in which such a photograph could be easily manufactured.

“The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop,” he said. “All the ‘artist’ had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbor and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.”

Earlier this year, another photograph of an unknown creature emerged from England, appearing to show “Bownessie,” an animal similar to the Loch Ness Monster. As The Inquisitr noted at the time, the surprisingly clear image was met with claims that it had been similarly created in Photoshop.

The largest known species of crustacean is the Japanese Spider Crab. Giant in comparison to other known species of crab, adults can grow to be 12 feet across.

TV show tricks chronic catcallers into harassing their own mothers,1218,disagree,"""How nice pants"" (referring to the rear) is probably the last sentence expect to hear a mother her son, still less that the tell her. Since last November 23 flows through social networks a video of Peru where a clash between two street bullies with their mothers is simulated and already numbers more than three million views on Youtube.



Under the slogan Sílbale your mother , the sports brand Everlast and the organization Stop Street Harassment -the first Latin American Observatory against acoso- recorded a mockumentary in which pretended to have identified bullies then contact their mothers, you change their look and make it happen where their children were.

This performance by actors is based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed by mistake to a female relative and expressed ""deep shame"". Another inspiration for starting the campaign was the famous case of harassment suffered by the Peruvian actress Magaly Solier, star of The Empty Nest, while traveling on public transport. ""I'm cholera in Peru not put a stop to sexual harassment in the public media. The rapist has more rights than the victims,"" ​​said the actress after the incident last May.


Natalia Málaga, coach of the national women's volleyball team, is responsible for instructing mothers in this video with appearance of hidden camera that was released two days before the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and has viralizado especially through Facebook pages as that of Hora Cero Web , a Mexican digital newspaper where he has two million views.

In YouTube video has reached Friday three million copies and has been featured in several publications in media throughout Latin America. In the official pages of Everlast has been shared more than 100,000 times, making it the most successful viral country, according to information provided by Maria Paz Delgado, head of marketing for Everlast Peru.

Málaga had starred in August Everlast another campaign in calling the attention of drivers insulting to women using a vehicle as boxing glove."
Meet the 3-boobed woman,661,agree,"You've heard of the third nipple — but what about a third breast?

A Tampa massage therapist, Jasmine Tridevil, underwent surgery to get just that. Tridevil told Orlando radio station Real Radio 104.1 that she spent close to $20,000 on the procedure.

Tridevil told the station that she contacted more than 50 doctors before finding one who would give her the third breast. ""It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she said. The surgeon she found couldn't create a silicone areola, though, so she had one tattooed onto the implant, which is made from silicone and skin tissue from her stomach.

While Tridevil's dream is to star in an MTV reality show, she told the radio station she had the surgery to become ""unattractive to men"" in addition to gaining fame. ""I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

Tridevil also noted that her parents are displeased with the surgery — her mother no longer speaks to her, and her father ""really isn't happy"" but has ""accepted it,"" she said. --Meghan DeMaria

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1741,discuss,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."
Argentine President Takes On Godson — But Not To Keep Werewolf At Bay,1421,disagree,"The tradition to stop stigma about the 'lobison' has continued for a century

The President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.

Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.

Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.

She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a “magical moment”.

Calling the Tawils a “marvellous family” she described Yair as “a total sweety” and dubbed his mother “Queen Esther.”

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers.

Pictures showed them lighting Hanukkah candles together on a menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family."
"'Sílbale your mother', the mockumentary to stop street harassment in Peru [Google Translate]",2029,disagree,"November 25th marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. So Everlast created this incredible video, demonstrating how some men disrespect women. A woman might simply be walking along the street before she ends up being harassed. And that’s pretty much what happens in this video. Except there’s a very shocking twist!
Right on! They totally deserved that… absolutely brilliant!

Watch Two Guys Appear to Get Tricked Into Catcalling Their Own Moms,1990,discuss,"Street harassment is something that happens to women all over the globe. It may begin to occur a lot less in Lima, Peru after an extremely creative Public Service Announcement, which was sponsored by Everlast aired. The video shows what happens when men harass an attractive woman in the street, only to soon find out that the woman is in fact their own mother in disguise. The results are nothing short of hilarious. The video is called Harassing Your Mother.

The host of the video starts out by saying:

“7 out of 10 women are sexually harassed on the streets of Lima, Peru. Men who do it think it is a minor offense. Let’s show them that they are wrong.”

They find “repeating offenders” who harass women on the streets, then proceed to get in contact with their mothers. The moms then get a makeover that makes then look fabulous and not immediately recognizable.

The first man in the video calls out to a woman that he does not know is actually his mother saying (at least according to the translation):



“Tasty panties!”

The mother then turns around and walks up to her son. The realization that he just catcalled his own mother dawns on him as he says, “Mama?”

She then wails on him. She says:

“What’s the matter with you Renzo? What they told me about you is true.”

The man then tries to desperately rationalize the awful thing he did to his mother telling her that it is, “just a game.”

They repeat the prank again one more time in the video, just to cement the idea they are trying to put out. Remember, the next woman you decide to harass on the street may turn out to be your mother, so maybe try not to do it. Okay?

‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,1632,disagree,"Jasmine Tridevil's 'three breasts' have gotten their 15 minutes of fame, but they've finally been exposed as a sham after all.

Florida station 10 News has now outed Tridevil third breast as fake after obtaining a luggage theft report filed earlier this month by the 21-year-old at Tampa International Airport.

In the report, Tridevil (going by her real name Alisha Hessler) lists the contents of a bag which was stolen off the American Airlines conveyor belt, including a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' inside.

Cops eventually tracked down the thieves using surveillance footage, and returned Hessler's black nylon bag - but not before taking an official inventory.

Scroll down for video

Con artist: The 'three-breasted' woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' has been exposed as a phony, after a lost luggage report was released. The report, filed earlier this month at Tampa International Airport, lists a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' as one of the contents of Tridevil's lost bag. It was eventually tracked down and returned

Contents: The above property receipt shows that Hessler's suitcase was stolen at Tampa International Aiport and returned earlier this month with a '3 breast prosthesis' inside

Earlier Tuesday, Tridevil's story began to fall apart when internet-rumor site Snopes connected the young woman to a Tampa, Florida massage therapist named Alisha Hessler.

Snopes discovered that the website JasmineTridevil.com is registered to a person named Alisha Hessler, and that Tridevil bares striking resemblance to a Tampa masseuse named Alisha Jasmine Hessler .

A website for Hessler's business - Alisha's Golden Touch - lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoaxes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted women'.

If Alisha Hessler is the woman behind Jasmine Tridevil, it may not be the fist time she has made national news.

In December 2013, a Tampa woman named Alisha Hessler made headlines when she had a alleged attacker stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding up a sign that reads 'I beat women'.

Debunked? Yesterday, a woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' (left) announced that she had undergone plastic surgery to add a third breast. That woman has now been connected to Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler (right) who owns the domain name JasmineTridevil.com. The two women bear a striking likeness

Damning evidence: A website for Hessler's business 'Alisha's Golden Touch' lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoazes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted woman [sic]'

Likeness: YouTube videos of Hessler showing off her massage skills also bare a similarity to Tridevil, who says she underwent the procedure to become unattractive to men

A view of the home where Alisha Jasmine Hessler, aka Jasmine Tridevilm lives in Tampa Florida on Tuesday, September 23

Police tried to contact Hessler about the alleged attack outside a night club but she 'stopped returning [their] calls' and never filed formal charges.

In March 2013, she was taken into custody in Hillsborough County, Florida and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'.

News of Tridevil's third breast emerged Monday, when she announced that she paid $20,000 for the addition in order to become a reality star.

She says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Hessler has gone into hiding since news of Tridevil grabbed national attention.

She was nowhere to be seen at her run down home in one of Tampa's poorer neighborhoods.

And if Hessler really is Tridevil, her 80-year-old grandfather Kenneth appeared not to have any idea about the radical transformation.

Attention grabber? In December 2013, a woman also named Alisha Hessler made national headlines when she alleged that she was attacked outside a nightclub by a man

News maker: Hessler subsequently made the man stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign reading 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. The story made national news

Speaking to MailOnline from his home in North Barrington, Illinois he said: 'We don't know what to believe. We did not know a thing about this'.

While Tridevil claims to have paid $20,000 for the operation, Hessler's rundown home in Tampa suggests someone who has struggled to make ends meet.

A decaying leather sofa had been dumped outside the tile and brick single story home which has rusting iron bars covering the downstairs windows.

Liar: Hessler was also arrested in March 2013 and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'

Broken plastic blinds have been drawn and the front garden is overgrown with weeds.

Neighbors said they hardly saw Hessler.

'She keeps very odd hours,' said one neighbor. 'You'd see her coming in at 6am when I'd be leaving to drive to work. She seemed nice enough but I don't believe her getting another breast. I just saw it on the news and it's fake. She just wants to make a name for herself.'

Other facts of Tridevil's story also don't line up, like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a WTSP reporter this week.

'I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet,' Jasmine said. '[Because] that's also going to be on my show where I'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and I want to save that.'

The only other pictures of her third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged...other than the WTSP footage.

In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs.

Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.

Selfies: The only pictures to emerge of Tridevil's third breast are self made. Tridevil did show her breast, but only very briefly to a WTSP reporter this week. She said she wasn't comfortable showing the breast too long because she wants to save it for her self-produced reality show

Scam? Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler is pictured above in the social media photos. She owns the domain name to JasmineTridevil.com

However, Tridevil claims a surgeon agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

MailOnline's calls to Hessler were not answered Tuesday morning.

Unethical: While the operation to add a third-breast is physical feasible, experts say that no surgeon would agree to carry out such a procedure on someone who may not be mentally well"
This Campaign Shows A Pretty Genius Way To Stop Men Catcalling In The Street,994,disagree,"A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf-whistling their own mothers.

The experiment took two mothers, whose sons were identified as repeat cat-callers, and disguised them using make-up, wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction.

The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend, before he makes a comment towards her

The mother then goes over to confront her child, who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent

The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty

The mother gets so angry with her son, she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour

In the first case, the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street.

The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying 'tasty panties' which prompts her to go and confront him.

She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat-called his own mother.

The mother then launches into a tirade, accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner.

Another mother, wearing a black wig walks past her son, who is standing working on the streets of Lima

After making a remark towards his mother, she then turns around and goes over to confront him

She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her son's behaviour

The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that, as he pleads with her to calm down

She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it.

Meanwhile in the second case, the mother wearing a green dress, walks past her son, who calls her 'piggy'.

She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son, hitting him with her hairpiece.

The man then tries to claim he didn't make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off

She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself, while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working.

He then tries to claim he didn't make the remark and it a man in a nearby car, but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off.

The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers.

It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima."

Report: Second American Journalist Beheaded by Islamic State Terrorists,1495,discuss,"BEIRUT — The ISIS terror group has published a video titled “A second message to America,” showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The video also threatens the life of British captive David Haines.

Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed, saying he is “paying the price” for U.S. intervention.

The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to President Barack Obama, telling him, “Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

Last week, Sotloff’s mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.

“Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,” she said. “He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.”

Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist, James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloff’s fate depended on what President Obama did next in Iraq.

Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public.

Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff’s release for the past year.

Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like “Lawrence of Arabia” and “The Big Lebowski” as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a “stand-up philosopher from Miami.”

In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area.

He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey — among other countries — and eventually Syria.

Sotloff’s killing likley will step up pressure on Obama to devise a strategy to combat ISIS.

On Friday, Obama said it’s too soon to discuss what steps the U.S. would take against the militant group inside Syria. On how to deal with the group in Syria — where it was born and has a safe haven, mostly in the city of Raqqa — the president said: “We don’t have a strategy yet.”

Obama said Friday that he has asked America’s top defense officials to prepare “a range of options.”"
Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,1460,agree,"Argentina's President Christina Fernández de Kirchner has a pretty solid plan for keeping her country safe from werewolves: She's going to adopt them.

There's apparently an obscure bit of Argentinian folklore that states the seventh son born to a family will turn into the feared el lobison on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday. The myth predicts the child will transform into a creature at midnight during each full moon, eternally damned to ravage the countryside before returning to human form.

Other fun bits of el lobison trivia, per The Independent: They feed on excrement, unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead; they're unnaturally strong; and they can spread their curse by biting.

The fear of el lobison's curse was so strong in Argentina that families abandoned – or in some cases murdered – their seventh son in the 19th century, which is how the tradition of the sitting president adopting one of these children came to pass in 1907. It was formally decreed in 1973 by then-president Juan Domingo Perón, and extended to baby girls at that time. Those adopted gain the sitting president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.




This year, Kirchner adopted the first Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil. The practice had extended only to Catholic children until 2009. Kirchner met with Yair and his parents, Shlomo and Nehama, on Dec. 23. She called the family ""marvelous,"" described Yair as ""a total sweetie,"" and bestowed the presidential nickname of ""Queen Esther"" on Nehama. (Shlomo and Nehama had sent in their request back in 1993.)"

"Rehana, Poster Girl for Kurdish Peshmerga, Alive and 'Fighting Fiercely,' After ISIS' Claims of Beheading Her",1944,discuss,"The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) reportedly beheaded a famous female Kurdish freedom fighter known only as ""Rehana."" The Women Protection Units (YPG) soldier fought against the terrorist group in Kobane, a strategically important border town in Syria near Turkey.
A picture of Rehana making the V-sign became a widely-distributed image online, retweeted over 5,000 times. Reports claimed she killed over 100 Islamic State jihadists single-handedly. But now a picture of a militant holding her head is making the rounds on social media. The death is not confirmed.
Female fighters are essential to the Kurds. The Women Protection Units (YPG) in Kobane are led by Mayass Abdo, who goes by Narin Afrin. All of the female Pershmerga are volunteers and are honored to fight against the terrorists. One such soldier, Dilar Gencxemis, blew herself up outside of Kobane, killing dozens of militants.
Their accomplishments as warriors aside, it is their gender the jihadists fear the most. They believe if they die in jihad, they will be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven. However, if a woman kills them, the men are denied their virgins.

ISIS Reported to Behead Second American,2289,discuss,"Updated 5:09 a.m. Wednesday:

U.S. officials say the video showing the beheading of a second U.S. journalist by militants of the Islamic State is authentic. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement Wednesday.

Original Post:

An Islamic radical group released a video on Tuesday that purportedly shows the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had threatened Sotloff's life when it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

At the time, the militants said Sotloff's life depended on the actions of the U.S. government, which has been targeting the group with airstrikes to stop its offensive in Iraq.

SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, posted a version of the video showing a man who looks like Sotloff kneeling next to a masked fighter holding a knife.

In his regular briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family and those who worked with him,"" Earnest said. ""The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff.""

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. would try to authenticate the video quickly.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act,"" she said.

Just last week, Sotloff's mother released an emotional video in which she pleaded with the Islamic State to spare her son's life.

Shirley Sotloff asked Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to grant her son amnesty, ""to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad who protected people of the Book.""

According to The Washington Post, Sotloff, 31, was a freelance journalist covering the civil war in Syria when he was captured in 2013. On his Twitter account, Sotloff described himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami,"" whose work has been published in Time and Foreign Policy.

NEWS/ Viral Video: What Happens When You Accidentally Catcall Your Mom,1910,disagree,"One tactic that should prevent overly hormonal street-bros from catcalling women is imagining what their own mothers would think of this behavior. In a new Peruvian ad, however, that threat becomes an all-too-real Freudian nightmare.


Athletics brand Everlast recently teamed up with activist group Paremos el Acoso Callejero (Stop Street Harassment) to teach catcallers on the streets of Lima what their mothers apparently never taught them--by using the people in the world most suited for that very task. In the viral video, which is clearly staged, although it's fun to pretend that it isn't, the Paremos team gets hold of the mothers of area serial harassers and recruits them for a guerrilla mission to end their sons' lives.


These women disguise themselves with dresses, wigs and a copious amount of makeup to go undercover as catcall-bait--and it works to a degree that will alternately delight and horrify. It's probably the funniest possible way to call attention to the fact that 7 out of 10 women on the streets of Peru are sexually assaulted. This dumb video may not be real, but the problem is, and it's a good way to remind potential catcallers of the inherent grossness of their actions."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,2292,disagree,"A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

So as usual without fear went fishing in the nearby Aldan region. From the road, a man went to the creek to winter quarters where usually stayed fishing. Weapons of a knife on his belt in his hands - rods, behind - the backpack.
To rain at times forced to throw a tight long cloak. A few kilometers left on the old highway. Pereobulsya, Bolotnikov tied to a backpack and walked toward the key Evota to zymes.
Coming in a somewhat macabre silence about three hundred meters, clearly felt that the rear - risk. At the same moment a powerful blow to the backpack knocked him down. Falling, he saw a couple of meters of a huge bear.
Igor himself considerable size, weight under one hundred pounds. But pounce beast with incredible force began to throw it as a toy. Poor fisherman tried to pull a knife, but the bitten hand predator is not obeyed, hanging whip.
What happened next, other than a miracle not to name. Bear attacks in the final chord in the chest and grabbed at the moment mobile fisherman made a sound.
- In the taiga time looked - it was 8:30 pm and put a mobile phone in his breast pocket - recalls that terrible battle Vorozhbitsyn. - I have an older model. Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri. Four hours of operation, and three surgeons literally collected on parched face bloodied pieces Igor. Then - three operations already in the Republican Hospital in Yakutsk. Fortunately, the fisherman left eye was saved. Igor saved and that the first shot hit on the head is not (bear paw easily cut out the skull), and a backpack. Played a protective role and dense coat. Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. But by a happy coincidence did not touch the internal organs and even ribs broken. And if not for mobile ...

Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman.
While doctors saved Igor Vorozhbitsyna hunters looking for a bear attacked him. Evoty literally combed the neighborhood with dogs. And on July 26 shot clumsy 2-3 years old. However, within a few kilometers hunters found more traces of bears. So what killed a man-eating beast or not, no one really can not tell."

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery.

Raven Symone Files Molestation Charges Against Bill Cosby,2262,disagree,"Raven-Symoné took to Instagram to deny rumors that Bill Cosby molested her while she was on The Cosby Show.

The rumor has been gaining steam for a few days now ever since a site called Hip Hop Hangover published a story claiming the actress was drugged and raped by Cosby and had filed charges against him. That site is (according to their own disclaimer) a ""gossip parody and satirical publication and for entertainment purposes only."" I have no idea who in the hell would consider a story about a young girl being drugged and raped ""entertainment"" but there you have the world of the Internet, folks. Snopes debunked this rumor awhile ago, but just in case people still need more proof, Raven-Symoné posted her own response to this on her Instagram page today:

I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!
I'm sorry that she even has to do this. Sites like this are not ""parody"" or ""satire"" sites, OK? They exist strictly to farm clicks by posting fake stories and deliberately manipulate people. (They should never been lumped in the same category as places like The Onion.) They know damn well that they what they're doing, and slapping a ""satire"" label on it shouldn't excuse their vulgarity and cheap ploy for attention.

CATCALLING IS NEVER FUNNY UNLESS IT'S THESE BROS TRICKED INTO CATCALLING THEIR MOTHERS,1990,agree,"Street harassment is something that happens to women all over the globe. It may begin to occur a lot less in Lima, Peru after an extremely creative Public Service Announcement, which was sponsored by Everlast aired. The video shows what happens when men harass an attractive woman in the street, only to soon find out that the woman is in fact their own mother in disguise. The results are nothing short of hilarious. The video is called Harassing Your Mother.

The host of the video starts out by saying:

“7 out of 10 women are sexually harassed on the streets of Lima, Peru. Men who do it think it is a minor offense. Let’s show them that they are wrong.”

They find “repeating offenders” who harass women on the streets, then proceed to get in contact with their mothers. The moms then get a makeover that makes then look fabulous and not immediately recognizable.

The first man in the video calls out to a woman that he does not know is actually his mother saying (at least according to the translation):



“Tasty panties!”

The mother then turns around and walks up to her son. The realization that he just catcalled his own mother dawns on him as he says, “Mama?”

She then wails on him. She says:

“What’s the matter with you Renzo? What they told me about you is true.”

The man then tries to desperately rationalize the awful thing he did to his mother telling her that it is, “just a game.”

They repeat the prank again one more time in the video, just to cement the idea they are trying to put out. Remember, the next woman you decide to harass on the street may turn out to be your mother, so maybe try not to do it. Okay?

"50ft crustacean, dubbed Crabzilla, photographed lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable",501,discuss,"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Or is it a giant crab?

Aerial images of a giant sea creature in Kent have appeared on the website Weird Whitstable which features all manner of supernatural stories and pictures.

The website reads: ""Crabbing is a popular activity for children during the summer.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbour reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?""

The jury is out on whether the image genuinley does show a giant crustaction and if there really is claws for concern.

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2270,agree,"After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil, 21, of Tampa had allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself ""unattractive to men,"" we've heard whispers in the wind (and read stories) that this Third Boob is a stunt, a hoax. It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...

Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as ""FALSE,"" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page, Tridevil's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body.

Trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night, where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another, longer look, Tridevil declined, telling the reporter, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Yes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.

Last year, Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading ""I BEAT WOMEN, HONK IF I'M A SCUMBAG"" in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident, but she apparently refused all the calls.

And in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.

Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:

This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.

And Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, ""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.""

So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the ""truth."" But the truth is, we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.

Meet the 3-boobed woman,157,disagree,"The woman claiming to have 3 boobs is A FRAUD ... A FAKE ... and ironically what exposed her lie is a crime someone committed against her.

Jasmine Tridevil has been making the rounds, claiming she got plastic surgery to netted her an additional boob.

But we got a document from the Tampa International Airport Police Dept. describing a baggage theft. According to the doc ... someone stole a bunch of luggage off an American Airlines conveyor belt, including a black nylon roller bag.

Cops caught the thieves after IDing them with surveillance video.   The black bag belonged to Tridevel, but before she got it back it was inventoried by police as part of the case against the crooks.

Guess what was inside the bag?  ""A 3 breast prosthesis.""

BTW ... she told cops the prosthesis was valued at $5K.

"Apple Reportedly Close to Acquiring 'Path', Looking to Integrate Service Into Messages",1811,discuss,"Last night, Pando reported that Apple is about to acquire Path, according to a single source in Apple's engineering team. We heard second-hand that Path is at least in talks with Apple. The idea that an app currently ranked no. 177 in the social networking category on iOS might end up in Apple's ion-strengthened embrace has left some in the tech community questioning their life choices.

What is the point of trying, if a Snapchat-copying Facebook derivative that followed questionable growth tactics with questionable financing from morally bankrupt Indonesian investors gets to sit in the front row next to Dre?

— Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014

But do not despair, fair founders! There are plenty of reasons why this deal is just business as usual in Silicon Valley and not the end of days.

1. Friends Buying Friends Acquisitions tend to be chummy affair. For example, Path CEO Dave Morin invested in Hot Potato, a company run by his ski buddy Justin Shaffer, Morin worked for Facebook, Facebook acquired Hot Potato. Karma, another Morin investment, was also acquired by Facebook. And Dave started his career at Apple helping give out iPods on college campuses. See, all in the family.

2. Buying CoolApple, which has $150 billion in cash, has been proven itself willing to buy new fans before with the Beats acquisition. But Path is the opposite of cool, you say. That is true, but Morin has proven himself to be a savvy and popular angel investor. In the interest of succession planning, a source told Valleywag, why wouldn't Apple let Morin rest and vest if it meant young CEOs dropping by Cupertino? ""He's a good exec, he's just a sub-par product person. He did well at Apple and Facebook because they had good products,"" added the source.

3. Messaging ManiaSilicon Valley corporations got smoked by Asian messaging apps. People like to communicate with their friends, who knew? Pando says that's part of Apple's renewed interest in social:

According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apple's newly refreshed Messages app. That doesn't mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebook's $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.

Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user.

Perhaps we'll hear more about the price tag when Morin takes the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in less than an hour.

4. No One Even Expects Acquisitions to SucceedSelling out can be a bummer not just for those in golden handcuffs, but for the buyers, says Pando:

Apple hasn't fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.

There, feel better?

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,998,discuss,"An astonishing image appears to show a giant crab, nearly 50 feet across, lurking in the harbor at Whitstable, Kent, and while some assert that it is a playful hoax, others believe they have found evidence of a genuine aquatic monster.

The aerial image reveals the outline of a crab at the mouth of Kent harbor, yet the size of the animal dwarfs fishing boats on a nearby pier, as the Daily Mail notes. The giant animal is shaped like an edible crab, a species commonly found in British waters, but which only grows to be ten inches across, on average.

People have flocked to the website Weird Whitstable since the image was first posted there, to judge its authenticity for themselves. Quinton Winter, who curates Weird Whitstable, asserted that the image of the giant crab was sent to him by a follower. At first, he believed that it showed only an unusually shaped sand formation, though he is now convinced that there truly is a strange animal lurking in the harbor.

While crabbing with his son in Whitstable harbor last year, Winter claims to have spotted the giant crab near shore, as he related to The Daily Express.

Save yourselves, Crabzilla has arrived in Whitstable http://t.co/W2NgcmJP24 pic.twitter.com/7RuUxSBUhB

— Sara Nelson (@SaraCNelson) October 13, 2014

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood,’ Winter said. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws… Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

In July of last year, another image emerged, depicting a giant crab lurking underneath a pier.

Another image, said to be taken in July of last year and posted on Winter’s Weird Whitstablog, purports to show a giant, albeit smaller, crab hiding under a pier.

“This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend,” claims Winter’s website, adding “The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

Graphic artist Ashley Austen noted his skepticism of the aerial image while speaking to Kent Online, describing the way in which such a photograph could be easily manufactured.

“The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop,” he said. “All the ‘artist’ had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbor and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.”

The largest known species of crustacean is the Japanese Spider Crab. Giant in comparison to other known species of crab, adults can grow to be 12 feet across.

This performance by actors is based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed by mistake to a female relative and expressed ""deep shame"". Another inspiration for starting the campaign was the famous case of harassment suffered by the Peruvian actress Magaly Solier, star of The Empty Nest, while traveling on public transport. ""I'm cholera in Peru not put a stop to sexual harassment in the public media. The rapist has more rights than the victims,"" ​​said the actress after the incident last May.

After a number of complaints from passengers about ""random males"" being seated next to their wives, Saudi Arabia's national airline is looking in to segregating their flights.

Saudi Arabia's national airline, Saudia, will order its staff to keep men and women seated separately on flights from now on after passengers complained about the lack of segregation on their flights.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,2107,agree,"Christina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a 13-year-old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, the Independent reports. Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves.

In Argentina, the werewolf is referred to as el lobison; in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison, and in Brazil it's called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend:

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

In Guaraní mythology, the lobison is the offspring of Tau, an evil spirit, and Kerana, a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison, that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper, whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains, by the 19th century, fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907, in an attempt to stop this practice, the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons, which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973, the Independent adds, the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters.

In addition to being able to say he's the president's godson, Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times, the curse, it seems, is more aptly described as a blessing."
Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,1782,discuss,"POLICE are investigating claims a doctor took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was unconscious on the operating table, before performing a biopsy she hadn’t consented to.

The shocking claim was made by a staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, where Rivers underwent a routine throat procedure on August 28.

After complications, the 81-year-old comedian was rushed to hospital where she died a week later.

SHOCK LOSS: Joan Rivers dead at 81

Investigators are looking in to claims that a second unnamed doctor entered the operating room after that initial procedure to conduct a biopsy on her vocal chords.

They are also probing claims by the staff member that the clinician who performed the biopsy first snapped a photo of himself with the sedated star.

FOND FAREWELL: Star-studded send-off at Joan Rivers’ funeral

CNN cited a source close to the investigation as saying that the vocal chord biopsy was not something Rivers had consented to.

That same source also said investigators believe Rivers could have suffered a heart attack after her throat began to swell during the biopsy, depriving her of oxygen.

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement denying the biopsy had taken place, but declined to comment on the selfie accusation."

Report: Woman who claimed to have third breast added is fake,1286,discuss,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

We think you’ll agree Leeb’s prosthetics are pretty convincing – could it be that Tridevil simply followed suit and hasn’t been under the knife after all?"
'Crabzilla' or 'Crapzilla' -- You Decide,2380,discuss,"The seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer.

He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax

'It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

'Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.'

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
Breast Chancer,2486,discuss,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,2298,discuss,"The National Security Council says it is ""appalled"" by the apparent beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,"" NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. ""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The NSC's statement came within an hour after ISIL reportedly released a video showing the murder of Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist who had written for Time, Foreign Policy and National Interest. According to the monitoring service SITE Intelligence Group, Sotloff was beheaded in the same manner as James Foley, the photojournalist who was killed last month. The executioner is reportedly the same man who killed Foley and threatened to kill Sotloff in the video released on Aug. 19.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that the White House could not immediately confirm the validity of the video but that ""our thoughts and prayers"" are with the Sotloff family."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1618,agree,"Did a woman claiming to have a third breast play a hoax on us?

Snopes.com came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay $20,000 (£12,190) for an extra breast.

It argued the fact she didn’t have anyone else take the photos was suspicious, and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevil.com was called Alisha Hessler, who was no stranger to the internet.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

A top plastic surgeon, Mr Nilesh Sojitra, also cast doubt over the surgery after claiming no ‘reasonable’ doctor would perform the operation

‘Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would,’ he told Buzzfeed.

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

Video purports to show beheading of US journalist,1309,discuss,"The United States government said early Wednesday that the video showing the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff at the hands of an Islamic State militant is authentic.

According to the Twitter page run by President Barack Obama's National Security Council:

The US Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing US citizen Steven Sotloff & reached judgment it is authentic.

— @NSCPress (@NSCPress) September 3, 2014

The video, which was discovered on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, showed Sotloff being beheaded in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to the slaying, Sotloff was shown kneeling on the ground and wearing orange clothing, a scene that was reminiscent of the Islamic State murder of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

The masked militant on the video warned President Barack Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, ""our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" He also threatened the life of David Haines, a British citizen and aid worker, who was kidnapped in March 2013.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelancer for Time magazine and Foreign Policy, was abducted in 2013 while covering the civil war in Syria.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Sotloff's murder a ""despicable crime,"" the BBC News reported.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement Wednesday, calling the killing of Sotloff ""unfathomable"" and ""an act of medieval savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.""

""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took,"" he said. ""And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.""

“You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as: Great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.”

This Third Boob Is Probably Only Real in Our Hearts,2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

'Throat specialist to the stars' allegedly involved in fatal Joan Rivers procedure denies taking selfie with star as she releases statement saying she will not comment on tragic incident,2357,discuss,"Rivers, 81, had checked in for routine throat procedure in Manhattan

Slipped into cardiac arrest around 9.40am on August 27

City official revealed how paramedics and other rescues came to her side

More than 10 people helped give her CPR, but couldn't revive the star

Rivers was put into a coma, and died on September 4

The doctor performing a biopsy on Joan Rivers’ vocal cord as she went into cardiac arrest allegedly took a selfie photo with the comedian while she was under anesthetic in the procedure room.

The physician hasn't been publicly identified, but is described as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

A member of staff at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators about the doctor's questionable behavior, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.

Death: Joan Rivers, 81, suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure on August 28

Clinic: Rivers was at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, which made the initial 911 call after she went into cardiac arrest

9:40 a.m, August 27: Yorkville Clinic called 911 with reports of a cardiac arrest.

9:45 a.m: The New York Fire Department response team arrives to find CPR underway, and takes over.

9:47 am: An ambulance from Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, arrives and joins in.

9.48am: A second NYFD unit with Emergency Medical Technicians, along with a supervisor, arrive at the clinic.

9:50 am: By this point the number of rescuers totals ten people.

Details of how emergency services responded to the star's unexpected cardiac arrest at a clinic in New York have emerged, allowing a timeline to be constructed of the cardiac arrest, which proved fatal.

Rivers, 81, had checked in for a routine throat procedure at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28, when her condition took a shocking turn for the worse.

She had to be put of life support, and died on September 4, prompting an outpouring of grief from the world of showbusiness.

Now, almost three weeks after the incident, a New York city official has revealed exactly how the different emergency services fought to save her, and that she was surrounded by rescuers within ten minutes.

The official told CNN that the response began with a 911 call from the clinic, which was given the highest priority.

The fire department were first to arrive at the clinic, five minutes after the call.

Medical staff were already trying to give Rivers CPR using a defibrillator and a breathing tube.

The firefighters then took over the attempts to revive her.

Two minutes after the firefighters came, an ambulance arrived at the clinic, whose paramedics helped with the CPR.

Almost immediately after that, another Fire Department vehicle arrived with medical aid, making a total of more than 10 people fighting to save her.

Rivers was taken from the clinic to Mount Sinai hospital in Manhattan, where she later died.

New York health authorities have launched an investigation into her death, amid speculation as to the exact nature of the procedure she was undergoing and who was treating her.

A director of the clinic has also resigned in the wake of the celebrity's death.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV."
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1128,disagree,"A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.

The Florida massage therapist, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, said she had the surgery a few months ago.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” Tridevil told Real Radio 104.1.

“I called like 50 or 60 doctors, nobody wanted to do it.”

Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radiohead’s Creep plays in the background.

Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts, “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she said.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune, this was not why she had the surgery.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore,” she said.

She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad ... he really isn’t happy ... he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said.

While some have criticised Tridevil for her chasing fame, others have described her as “beautiful” and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci fi film Total Recall.

“I love boobs, you have three, what’s not to like ... we all loved that girl in Total Recall, now your (sic) the real deal,” said one follower on her Facebook page.

Argentine President Takes On Godson — But Not To Keep Werewolf At Bay,861,disagree,"The president of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish grandson in order to prevent him becoming a werewolf.

Hmmm, let us explain.

According to an old Argentinian legend, the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between is liable to turn into one of the mythical creatures.

Fear was so rife in the country that families would often give up their seventh-born sons for adoption or even kill them.

In the 1920s a law was passed to counteract the legend. It offered presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday but only for Catholic families.

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written to the then- president in 1993 but were turned down. After the updated law was passed they tried again and Kirchner agreed.

She said: ""It was magical to receive Iair Tawil, the first presidential godson in national history to profess the Jewish faith. Iair, 21, is completely sweet.

The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,1632,agree,"Jasmine Tridevil's 'three breasts' have gotten their 15 minutes of fame, but they've finally been exposed as a sham after all.

Florida station 10 News has now outed Tridevil third breast as fake after obtaining a luggage theft report filed earlier this month by the 21-year-old at Tampa International Airport.

In the report, Tridevil (going by her real name Alisha Hessler) lists the contents of a bag which was stolen off the American Airlines conveyor belt, including a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' inside.

Cops eventually tracked down the thieves using surveillance footage, and returned Hessler's black nylon bag - but not before taking an official inventory.

Scroll down for video

Con artist: The 'three-breasted' woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' has been exposed as a phony, after a lost luggage report was released. The report, filed earlier this month at Tampa International Airport, lists a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' as one of the contents of Tridevil's lost bag. It was eventually tracked down and returned

Contents: The above property receipt shows that Hessler's suitcase was stolen at Tampa International Aiport and returned earlier this month with a '3 breast prosthesis' inside

Earlier Tuesday, Tridevil's story began to fall apart when internet-rumor site Snopes connected the young woman to a Tampa, Florida massage therapist named Alisha Hessler.

Snopes discovered that the website JasmineTridevil.com is registered to a person named Alisha Hessler, and that Tridevil bares striking resemblance to a Tampa masseuse named Alisha Jasmine Hessler .

A website for Hessler's business - Alisha's Golden Touch - lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoaxes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted women'.

If Alisha Hessler is the woman behind Jasmine Tridevil, it may not be the fist time she has made national news.

In December 2013, a Tampa woman named Alisha Hessler made headlines when she had a alleged attacker stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding up a sign that reads 'I beat women'.

Debunked? Yesterday, a woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' (left) announced that she had undergone plastic surgery to add a third breast. That woman has now been connected to Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler (right) who owns the domain name JasmineTridevil.com. The two women bear a striking likeness

Damning evidence: A website for Hessler's business 'Alisha's Golden Touch' lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoazes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted woman [sic]'

Likeness: YouTube videos of Hessler showing off her massage skills also bare a similarity to Tridevil, who says she underwent the procedure to become unattractive to men

A view of the home where Alisha Jasmine Hessler, aka Jasmine Tridevilm lives in Tampa Florida on Tuesday, September 23

Police tried to contact Hessler about the alleged attack outside a night club but she 'stopped returning [their] calls' and never filed formal charges.

In March 2013, she was taken into custody in Hillsborough County, Florida and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'.

News of Tridevil's third breast emerged Monday, when she announced that she paid $20,000 for the addition in order to become a reality star.

She says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Hessler has gone into hiding since news of Tridevil grabbed national attention.

She was nowhere to be seen at her run down home in one of Tampa's poorer neighborhoods.

And if Hessler really is Tridevil, her 80-year-old grandfather Kenneth appeared not to have any idea about the radical transformation.

Attention grabber? In December 2013, a woman also named Alisha Hessler made national headlines when she alleged that she was attacked outside a nightclub by a man

News maker: Hessler subsequently made the man stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign reading 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. The story made national news

Speaking to MailOnline from his home in North Barrington, Illinois he said: 'We don't know what to believe. We did not know a thing about this'.

While Tridevil claims to have paid $20,000 for the operation, Hessler's rundown home in Tampa suggests someone who has struggled to make ends meet.

A decaying leather sofa had been dumped outside the tile and brick single story home which has rusting iron bars covering the downstairs windows.

Liar: Hessler was also arrested in March 2013 and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'

Broken plastic blinds have been drawn and the front garden is overgrown with weeds.

Neighbors said they hardly saw Hessler.

'She keeps very odd hours,' said one neighbor. 'You'd see her coming in at 6am when I'd be leaving to drive to work. She seemed nice enough but I don't believe her getting another breast. I just saw it on the news and it's fake. She just wants to make a name for herself.'

Other facts of Tridevil's story also don't line up, like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a WTSP reporter this week.

'I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet,' Jasmine said. '[Because] that's also going to be on my show where I'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and I want to save that.'

The only other pictures of her third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged...other than the WTSP footage.

In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs.

Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.

Selfies: The only pictures to emerge of Tridevil's third breast are self made. Tridevil did show her breast, but only very briefly to a WTSP reporter this week. She said she wasn't comfortable showing the breast too long because she wants to save it for her self-produced reality show

Scam? Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler is pictured above in the social media photos. She owns the domain name to JasmineTridevil.com

However, Tridevil claims a surgeon agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

MailOnline's calls to Hessler were not answered Tuesday morning.

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Her parents, though, apparently did not take the news in stride.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

Florida woman gets plastic surgery to add a third breast,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1907,disagree,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,1902,disagree,"A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax.

Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour.

But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big.

This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast

The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax

Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant ""crabzilla"" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax.

'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.'

She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo.

'Crabs with a ""pie crust edge"", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.'

Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged

The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs, which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep

Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long

Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore.

'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.'

Woman with three breasts: Real or hoax?,1924,discuss,"A Florida massage therapist said she paid $20,000 for a third breast in hopes of becoming less attractive to men

""I don't want to date anymore,"" Jasmine Tridevil told Orlando's Real Radio 104.1.

Tridevil, 21, has documented her post-surgery life through photos and videos posted to YouTube, Facebook and other social media sites -- mostly images of her posing in custom-made three-cup bikinis and bras.

Her desire to repel the opposite sex with her updated anatomy wasn't her only motivation for the surgery: Tridevil also hopes to have her own show on MTV someday.

She said she contacted more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to perform the operation."
Third boob likely a hoax,746,discuss,"You won’t believe this one.

According to Buzzfeed, a young woman from Tampa, Fla., has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on “Inside Edition” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But so far at least that part of her story isn't panning out.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, wrote on Facebook: “So I'm flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

But Kimmel is famous for online pranks, including a viral video called ""Worst twerk fail EVER,"" purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident, that turned out to be staged by his show.

HEALTH: Purported third-breast add raises medical, ethical questions

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.

Well, she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another ""Total Recall"" remake.

This Third Boob Is Probably Only Real in Our Hearts,2486,agree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,1741,discuss,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."
Blood money: How ISIS is selling human organs harvested from living hostages and its own dead soldiers to fund terror across the Middle East,2151,agree,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.

Original Article اقرا المقال الأصلي باللغة العربية
According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."
Meet the 3-boobed woman,785,disagree,"She made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as Tampa Bay’s 10 News revealed Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three-breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on Sept. 16.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prosthesis.”

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumor site Snopes also discovered that her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone to whom Tridevil bears a striking resemblance.

However, when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be skeptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Photo: FaceookTridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 to 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for.”

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn agreed that while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely that anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip, Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple,” which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” on her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different … that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre-surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

It’s not the first time Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after he made unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges, she offered her attacker an ultimatum, telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women.’”

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1490,agree,"Jasmine Tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob, but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff. Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible, it is not plausible.

""[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” Dr. Matthew Schulman, a board-certified plastic surgeon in New York, told the Daily Dot. “I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.""

There are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevil’s story. The first is the photographic “evidence” of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered, the Daily Dot wrote.

Second, creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required.

When asked about her surgery, Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She didn’t mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery.

The final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevil’s third breast is fake was the final result. “This technique would create a tight, round breast in the center of the chest,” he said. “Also, all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft, pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast, and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure.”

During a radio interview, Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a “striking” resemblance to Alisha Hessler, the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVIL.com is registered.

Hessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her, Snopes wrote. She reportedly made a man hold a sign that said “I beat women.” She withdrew her complaint with the police department after she was asked for details about the alleged attack, Buzzfeed wrote.

Tridevil said on her Facebook account Tuesday Alisha Hessler is her real name. She also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone else’s identification to get into a club. “I was underage and wanted to get drunk lol,” she wrote.

She told The Sun her claim is not a hoax and her film crew recorded her procedure. She said she will release the footage when she gets a reality television show and “I really don’t care what people say about me.”

Woman Gets Third Boob to Appear Unattractive to Men,2258,discuss,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

No gender segregation on Saudia,784,discuss,"Saudi Arabia’s national carrier has reportedly decided to impose separate seating on its male and female passengers.

The plan is being implemented by Saudi Airlines due to a rash of complaints from men who said they did not want their wives sitting next to other men, the Daily Mail reported, citing Gulf media.

“There are solutions to this problem… we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudi Airlines’ assistant manager for marketing, Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, was quoted as saying.

According to the report, close relatives will be allowed to sit together.

The plan reportedly also follows recent complaints from male passengers about a “flirty” flight attendant.

Saudi women are not employed as flight attendants by the airline, which instead hires women from other countries, the report said.

Saudi Arabia enforces a strict segregation of the sexes in public spaces, and famously forbids women from driving motor vehicles.

Women are required to wear a headscarf and loose, black robes in public.

Operators of flights to and from Israel have faced similar complaints from men who refused to sit next to women.

An international flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed for half an hour on December 20 after ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refused to sit between two women.

The flight crew of Delta Flight 468 departing John F. Kennedy Airport attempted to find other seats for the men. But other passengers refused to swap seats in protest at their refusal to sit next to female passengers, according to a Friday report by Israel Radio.

The men were finally accommodated by an American passenger who agreed to switch seats.

According to Federal Aviation Authority regulations, a flight is not permitted to take off until all passengers are seated.

In September, an El Al flight was grounded after a group of ultra-Orthodox men refused to sit next to a female passenger, resulting in an 11-hour delay described as a “nightmare” by passengers.

That incident sparked a petition calling on EL AL to protect its female travelers by reserving “a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight, where for a fee, those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take-off to change seats with them — thereby avoiding arguments, bullying, and delayed take-off.”"

This Man Kept HARASSING Women On The Streets.

Earlier Tuesday, Tridevil's story began to fall apart when internet-rumor site Snopes connected the young woman to a Tampa, Florida massage therapist named Alisha Hessler.

Snopes discovered that the website JasmineTridevil.com is registered to a person named Alisha Hessler, and that Tridevil bares striking resemblance to a Tampa masseuse named Alisha Jasmine Hessler .

A website for Hessler's business - Alisha's Golden Touch - lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoaxes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted women'.

Police tried to contact Hessler about the alleged attack outside a night club but she 'stopped returning [their] calls' and never filed formal charges.

In March 2013, she was taken into custody in Hillsborough County, Florida and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'.

News of Tridevil's third breast emerged Monday, when she announced that she paid $20,000 for the addition in order to become a reality star.

She says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Hessler has gone into hiding since news of Tridevil grabbed national attention.

She was nowhere to be seen at her run down home in one of Tampa's poorer neighborhoods.

And if Hessler really is Tridevil, her 80-year-old grandfather Kenneth appeared not to have any idea about the radical transformation.

Attention grabber? In December 2013, a woman also named Alisha Hessler made national headlines when she alleged that she was attacked outside a nightclub by a man

News maker: Hessler subsequently made the man stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign reading 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. The story made national news

Speaking to MailOnline from his home in North Barrington, Illinois he said: 'We don't know what to believe. We did not know a thing about this'.

While Tridevil claims to have paid $20,000 for the operation, Hessler's rundown home in Tampa suggests someone who has struggled to make ends meet.

A decaying leather sofa had been dumped outside the tile and brick single story home which has rusting iron bars covering the downstairs windows.

Liar: Hessler was also arrested in March 2013 and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'

Broken plastic blinds have been drawn and the front garden is overgrown with weeds.

Neighbors said they hardly saw Hessler.

'She keeps very odd hours,' said one neighbor. 'You'd see her coming in at 6am when I'd be leaving to drive to work. She seemed nice enough but I don't believe her getting another breast. I just saw it on the news and it's fake. She just wants to make a name for herself.'

Other facts of Tridevil's story also don't line up, like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a WTSP reporter this week.

'I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet,' Jasmine said. '[Because] that's also going to be on my show where I'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and I want to save that.'

The only other pictures of her third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged...other than the WTSP footage.

In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs.

Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.

Selfies: The only pictures to emerge of Tridevil's third breast are self made. Tridevil did show her breast, but only very briefly to a WTSP reporter this week. She said she wasn't comfortable showing the breast too long because she wants to save it for her self-produced reality show

Scam? Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler is pictured above in the social media photos. She owns the domain name to JasmineTridevil.com

However, Tridevil claims a surgeon agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

MailOnline's calls to Hessler were not answered Tuesday morning.

Unethical: While the operation to add a third-breast is physical feasible, experts say that no surgeon would agree to carry out such a procedure on someone who may not be mentally well"
Woman Gets Third Boob to Appear Unattractive to Men,2392,disagree,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
White House denies it threatened families of slain American journalists,2195,agree,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is denying claims that the administration threatened legal action against the families of kidnapped Americans if they paid ransom to their captors, the Islamic State.

McDonough hit a series of Sunday interview shows to promote the administration's counterterrorism plan against the Islamic State, including a plea to Congress to fund anti-Islamic State forces in Syria.

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff — American journalists beheaded by the Islamic State — said the government objected when they considered ransom payments, and even threatened prosecution.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. ""That's our responsibility, to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Ransom payments are prohibited under U.S. law, on the theory they would encourage terrorist groups to kidnap more Americans.

McDonough said he sympathized with the Foley and Sotloff families, and noted that the administration attempted a hostage rescue in Syria.

""We took every effort — and will continue to take every effort — to secure people,"" he said.

In discussing the counter-terrorism plan, McDonough urged Congress to fund anti-Islamic State fighters in Syria, and said the U.S. is ""obviously"" at war with the militant group.

The interviews aired a day after the Islamic State beheaded a third hostage, British aid worker David Haines

The plan that Obama announced Wednesday includes the prospect of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, while expanding ongoing strikes in neighboring Iraq.

Obama, McDonough, and other aides say the plan features assistance to local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS.

In his round of interviews, McDonough echoed Obama's pledge to avoid using U.S. combat troops, and to rely on forces in Syria and Iraq.

""That's why the Syrian opposition is so important,"" McDonough said on CNN's State of the Union, later adding that ""it's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL.""

On ABC's This Week, McDonough said that ""what we want to make sure happens is that we have committed partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. And they will have not only support from us from the air, but they'll also have training and equipment support from us.""

Lawmakers and analysts have questioned Obama's plan, saying that the United States will have to get more involved — including the prospect of ground troops — if the Islamic State is to be defeated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration is ""delusional"" about its plan.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said. ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion ... It's about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army — they're intending to come here.""

Graham also said of Obama: ""This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home.""

Administration officials have offered different descriptions of the administrations's plan, ranging from ""counter-terrorism operations"" to outright ""war.""

On NBC's Meet The Press, McDonough said that ""as much as we've been at war with al Qaeda since we got here, we're at war with ISIL.""

It is ""a complicated effort,"" McDonough said, and ""success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States — an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq, or otherwise.""

Secretary of State John Kerry, who has disputed the use of the term ""war,"" told CBS' Face The Nation that ""there's frankly a kind of tortured debate going on about terminology ... What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL."""
"Saudi airline, Saudia, to ban gender-mixing",784,discuss,"Saudi Arabia’s national carrier has reportedly decided to impose separate seating on its male and female passengers.

The plan is being implemented by Saudi Airlines due to a rash of complaints from men who said they did not want their wives sitting next to other men, the Daily Mail reported, citing Gulf media.

“There are solutions to this problem… we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers,” Saudi Airlines’ assistant manager for marketing, Abdul Rahman Al Fahd, was quoted as saying.

According to the report, close relatives will be allowed to sit together.

The plan reportedly also follows recent complaints from male passengers about a “flirty” flight attendant.

Saudi women are not employed as flight attendants by the airline, which instead hires women from other countries, the report said.

Saudi Arabia enforces a strict segregation of the sexes in public spaces, and famously forbids women from driving motor vehicles.

Women are required to wear a headscarf and loose, black robes in public.

Operators of flights to and from Israel have faced similar complaints from men who refused to sit next to women.

An international flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed for half an hour on December 20 after ultra-Orthodox Jewish men refused to sit between two women.

The flight crew of Delta Flight 468 departing John F. Kennedy Airport attempted to find other seats for the men. But other passengers refused to swap seats in protest at their refusal to sit next to female passengers, according to a Friday report by Israel Radio.

The men were finally accommodated by an American passenger who agreed to switch seats.

According to Federal Aviation Authority regulations, a flight is not permitted to take off until all passengers are seated.

In September, an El Al flight was grounded after a group of ultra-Orthodox men refused to sit next to a female passenger, resulting in an 11-hour delay described as a “nightmare” by passengers.

That incident sparked a petition calling on EL AL to protect its female travelers by reserving “a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight, where for a fee, those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take-off to change seats with them — thereby avoiding arguments, bullying, and delayed take-off.”"
"Woman pays $20,000 for third breast to make herself LESS attractive to men",2486,disagree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

ISIS Reported to Behead Second American,1250,discuss,"BEIRUT (AP) - An Internet video purports to show the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State group.

Sotloff, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syrian in August 2013 until he appeared in a video released online last month by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq.

In the video distributed Tuesday and entitled ""A Second Message to America,"" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter.

A Florida native, Sotloff grew up in Miami. He graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he received a journalism award, according to Manchester TV station WMUR. He went on to attend the University of Central Florida.

Sotloff's mother recently made a video appeal, pleading for the release of her son."
Report: Egyptian President Makes Surprising Suggestion to Move the Location of a Future Palestinian State,2462,discuss,"Egyptian President General Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has offered Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas the chance to create a Palestinian state in the Sinai Peninsula, according to local Israeli media.

The offer to the Palestinian President which, reports say Abbas has denied, would have seen 1,600 square kilometres of the Sinai Peninsula given to the Palestinian Authority, creating a Palestinian state five times the size of Gaza.

According to IDF Radio, the offer would see Abbas relinquish demands that Israel return to the 1967 borders.

In the new and enlarged Gaza, the territory would be demilitarised and Palestinian refugees, many who were unable to return to their towns after the creation of Israel, would have been able to settle there.

As part of the proposal, Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank would have been autonomous and continued to be under Palestinian Authority control.

Sisi allegedly said to Abbas in the meeting: ""You are now 80 years old, if you don't accept this proposal, your successor will.""

The Palestinian Authority is yet to publicly comment on the initiative but unnamed sources said that Abbas rejected the deal in a meeting with Sisi.

The Israeli military radio station said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had knowledge of the offer and that the United States had given its approval to such an idea.

An idea along the same lines was introduced years ago by Israeli academics but Egypt rejected the proposal.

Elsewhere, the future of a unity government between Abbas' Fatah and Hamas remains uncertain after the Palestinian president voiced his displeasure at the Islamist group's ""shadow"" leadership of Gaza.

""We cannot continue working with Hamas this way. There are 27 undersecretaries of ministries who are running the Gaza Strip, and the national unity government cannot do anything on the ground.

""We won't accept the continuation of the situation with Hamas as it is now and in this shape,"" he said. ""There must be one authority and one regime.""

Gaza is still recovering from a 50-day conflict which saw more than 2,100 Palestinians killed as well as 66 Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli civilians.

Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,2292,disagree,"A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,889,agree,"Tampa, Florida -- Jasmine Tridevil had made international headlines by posting pictures and videos claiming she got a third breast implanted into the center of her chest.

And indeed, from the outset many were very suspicious of the authenticity of Tridevil's claims. Snopes.com, the urban legends website, took an in-depth look at her story and concluded the facts decisively pointed to a hoax.

And now perhaps the final piece of evidence: 10 News has received an an incident report from Tampa International Airport, where earlier this month Tridevil (real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler) reported her baggage had been stolen.

The luggage was eventually recovered and two people were arrested for stealing several bags off of the airport conveyor belts. When Tridevil went to retrieve her recovered items, a property receipt was written that listed the contents contained within:

The ISIS Executioner Who Killed 4 Hostages May Have Been Wounded In Airstrikes,1977,discuss,"Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a U.S.-led air strike last week.

The man, dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the British media, was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.

The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also said to have been wounded in the attack, the paper added.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in U.S. air strikes.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq.

According to the Mail on Sunday, which said its source was an unnamed nurse, ""Jihadi John"", Baghdadi and other wounded IS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were.

In videos released by Islamic State, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons.

‘Crabzilla’ a 50-foot colossal conundrum,2023,discuss,"Debate is raging online as to whether pic shows super-sized snapper of the Kent coast could be the biggest ever to grace UK shores

Is this Britain's biggest crab caught on camera?

The shock snap clicked from the air has caused a stir online, with many convinced it shows a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

But others claim the photo is fishy - and is nothing more than a oddly-shaped sandbank or a a bit of image manipulation.

The 'super crab' picture shows the harbour at Whitstable, Kent. And the unexplained 'creature of the deep' dwarfs fishing boats left on the nearby pier

The pic appeared on the website Weird Whitstable - a collection of the strange put together by Quinton Winter.

Weird Whitstable   Claws for concern: Is this picture shared on the internet the biggest crab the banks of Britain have ever seen?

He told the Daily Express that he saw the mega-crab last summer.

Quinton said: ""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood'.

""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

""Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

The world's largest recorded crab is the Japanese spider crab, a species which can grow to around 12ft and weigh up to three stone.

Poll loading …"
‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,2182,discuss,"“The aerial shot enables viewers to see the full body of the crab, including its pinchers and legs,” says the AOL article.
The article also mentions a man who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual. He reportedly thought the creature in question was initially driftwood with a striking resemblance to a crab, but then later explained he now thinks the crab is real.
By the way, the largest known crab in the world is the Japanese spider crab. But even that one only measures up to about one-fourth the size of this alleged “Crabzilla.” They can measure 12 feet across from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds.

Triple-breasted woman pictured before 'operation' and vows surgery footage will prove third boob is no hoax,2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,1960,discuss,The woman who claims she added a third breast provides photos to prove it.
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,596,agree,The woman who reported that she added a third breast was most likely lying.
The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,2258,discuss,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

Looks familiar: A three-breasted woman makes an appearance in 1990's Total Recall

Dr Mossi Salibian, a member of the hospital’s multidisciplinary breast expert team, said such a procedure would be possible, but mercifully added he didn’t believe any doctor would perform such an operation.

He said: “There are many things that are possible, but that doesn’t mean we would do it.”

HP Is Planning To Split Into Two Separate Businesses,1838,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +2.00%  plans to break in two, separating its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the people said. It is expected to be effected as a tax-free distribution of shares to the company’s stockholders next year, one of the people said.

The move is one H-P and its investors and analysts have long contemplated. It would come amid a wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world, underpinned by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—if not actively sought by them.

On Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

In 2012, under current H-P CEO Meg Whitman, H-P reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation.

Ms. Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the separate, so-called enterprise company, one of the people said. Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business, this person said.

In fiscal 2013, the printing and personal systems group, as it is known, inked $55.9 billion in revenue, about half the Palo Alto, Calif., company’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for the company as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd, according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P, famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto 75 years ago, has been undergoing a multiyear restructuring under Ms. Whitman as the company tries to stem sales declines. Aside from the PC and printer business, the rest of H-P’s revenue comes from selling services and hardware such as servers and data-storage systems to corporations, as well as software and financial services.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since last year, but are still well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached in the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

To combat lower sales and provide lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as cloud software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

H-P has also been contemplating big strategic changes lately. Over much of the past year, the company held talks to merge with data-storage giant EMC Corp., but those negotiations, which would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion, recently ended.

Crabzilla,893,discuss,"Leading invertebrate researcher says ""a hoax is an understatement"" of photograph appearing to show a colossal crustacean basking off the Kent coastline

A fifty-foot crab dwelling somewhere off the English coast is a thing of nightmares.

The shadowy figure of a colossal crustacean, apparently spotted in the murky waters of Whistable, in Kent, dwarfs boats and cars on the pier it lurks besides.

A satellite picture of the so-called crab, aptly dubbed ‘Crabzilla’, has gone viral after first surfacing on Weird Whitstable, a website for the supernatural curated by illustrator Quinton Winter, which deals in “phantoms, mysteries, tall tales, and artefacts”.

The creature is depicted in the coastal town’s harbour, which is a popular spot for children to go crabbing in the summer.

But those suffering from ostraconophobia (that’s fear of shellfish to you and me) needn’t be left gasping for air, because invertebrate expert Paul Clark at the Natural History Museum in London has branded the photo a hoax.

""I had a good giggle about it - it's ridiculous,"" he said, adding that it ""is definitely not real.""

Here's why:

1. The largest crabs in the world are thought to be Japanese spider crabs - also known as Macrocheira kaempferi - which can grow to the size of a small car with an impressive leg span of up to twelve feet. However, these crabs live in deep, cold water around Japan and are a completely different shape.

2. Another huge crab with a more similar shape to the one in the picture is the Tasmanian giant crab, also known as Pseudocarcinus gigas. These are the world's heaviest crabs but they reside in the southern waters of Australia at depths of 20-820 metres.

3. Mr Clark did not think that the crab was a representation of Cancer pagurus, also known as the edible crab, either because of a slightly different shape. And anyway, these tend to only grow to a maximum of 30 centimetres.

4. Instead, he said that the crab looked more to him like a shore crab (Carcinus maenas) - cleverly Photoshopped on to a satellite image. ""A hoax is an understatement. A shore crab gets up to two inches - if you're lucky!"" he said.

5. Internet hoax debunkers have also been on the case, with a user from ThatsNonsense.com pointing out that the the image of the harbour was taken from Bing maps, sans crustacean in the original satellite photograph, of course."
Another Victim? Raven-Symoné Reveals What Really Happened On ‘Cosby Show’ Set,2262,discuss,"Raven-Symoné took to Instagram to deny rumors that Bill Cosby molested her while she was on The Cosby Show.

The rumor has been gaining steam for a few days now ever since a site called Hip Hop Hangover published a story claiming the actress was drugged and raped by Cosby and had filed charges against him. That site is (according to their own disclaimer) a ""gossip parody and satirical publication and for entertainment purposes only."" I have no idea who in the hell would consider a story about a young girl being drugged and raped ""entertainment"" but there you have the world of the Internet, folks. Snopes debunked this rumor awhile ago, but just in case people still need more proof, Raven-Symoné posted her own response to this on her Instagram page today:

I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!
I'm sorry that she even has to do this. Sites like this are not ""parody"" or ""satire"" sites, OK? They exist strictly to farm clicks by posting fake stories and deliberately manipulate people. (They should never been lumped in the same category as places like The Onion.) They know damn well that they what they're doing, and slapping a ""satire"" label on it shouldn't excuse their vulgarity and cheap ploy for attention.

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,2026,disagree,"After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

Argentine President Takes On Godson — But Not To Keep Werewolf At Bay,1460,disagree,"Argentina's President Christina Fernández de Kirchner has a pretty solid plan for keeping her country safe from werewolves: She's going to adopt them.

There's apparently an obscure bit of Argentinian folklore that states the seventh son born to a family will turn into the feared el lobison on the first Friday after the boy's 13th birthday. The myth predicts the child will transform into a creature at midnight during each full moon, eternally damned to ravage the countryside before returning to human form.

Other fun bits of el lobison trivia, per The Independent: They feed on excrement, unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead; they're unnaturally strong; and they can spread their curse by biting.

The fear of el lobison's curse was so strong in Argentina that families abandoned – or in some cases murdered – their seventh son in the 19th century, which is how the tradition of the sitting president adopting one of these children came to pass in 1907. It was formally decreed in 1973 by then-president Juan Domingo Perón, and extended to baby girls at that time. Those adopted gain the sitting president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.




This year, Kirchner adopted the first Jewish seventh son, Yair Tawil. The practice had extended only to Catholic children until 2009. Kirchner met with Yair and his parents, Shlomo and Nehama, on Dec. 23. She called the family ""marvelous,"" described Yair as ""a total sweetie,"" and bestowed the presidential nickname of ""Queen Esther"" on Nehama. (Shlomo and Nehama had sent in their request back in 1993.)"

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,2380,discuss,"The seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer.

He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax

'It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

'Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.'

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,1618,agree,"Did a woman claiming to have a third breast play a hoax on us?

Snopes.com came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay $20,000 (£12,190) for an extra breast.

It argued the fact she didn’t have anyone else take the photos was suspicious, and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevil.com was called Alisha Hessler, who was no stranger to the internet.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

A top plastic surgeon, Mr Nilesh Sojitra, also cast doubt over the surgery after claiming no ‘reasonable’ doctor would perform the operation

‘Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would,’ he told Buzzfeed.

ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,1309,discuss,"The United States government said early Wednesday that the video showing the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff at the hands of an Islamic State militant is authentic.

According to the Twitter page run by President Barack Obama's National Security Council:

The US Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing US citizen Steven Sotloff & reached judgment it is authentic.

— @NSCPress (@NSCPress) September 3, 2014

The video, which was discovered on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, showed Sotloff being beheaded in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to the slaying, Sotloff was shown kneeling on the ground and wearing orange clothing, a scene that was reminiscent of the Islamic State murder of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

The masked militant on the video warned President Barack Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, ""our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" He also threatened the life of David Haines, a British citizen and aid worker, who was kidnapped in March 2013.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelancer for Time magazine and Foreign Policy, was abducted in 2013 while covering the civil war in Syria.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Sotloff's murder a ""despicable crime,"" the BBC News reported.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement Wednesday, calling the killing of Sotloff ""unfathomable"" and ""an act of medieval savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.""

""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took,"" he said. ""And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.""

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1286,discuss,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

We think you’ll agree Leeb’s prosthetics are pretty convincing – could it be that Tridevil simply followed suit and hasn’t been under the knife after all?"

UK looking into reports IS beheading suspect wounded,809,discuss,"Masked Isis executioner Jihadi John has been injured in US led airstrikes, it has been reported.

The unidentified Briton, who savagely beheaded two British and two American hostages held captive by Islamic State, is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq, an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border, last Saturday (8 November).

American and Iraqi jets targeted the meeting of around 30 of the militant group's leaders, held in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house.

“We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them.”- The Foreign Office

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

It was originally thought that IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed in the attack, however audio recordings emerged later confirming he survived. It was not known that Jihadi John had been present at the meeting.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them.""

""We have a number of sources of information coming in. The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don't have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.""

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ""We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.""

A spokesman for US Central Command said they are also unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The executioner, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was reportedly rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. According to source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, commenting that it was ""the one who slaughtered the journalists.""

The extent of his injuries is not yet known, but a source said that urgent calls were made through the local mosque's loudspeakers, appealing for the town's residents to donate blood at the hospital.

After being treated at the hospital, Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and several other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelled 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

They were transferred to two captured Syrian army barracks and treated within the secure confines of the underground medical facilities. Hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, for the treatment of the injured terrorist leaders.

Jihadi John was videoed beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31.

In the most recent execution video of Mr Henning, released last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

In September, FBI Director James Comey confirmed the American bureau had identified the foreign jihadist after weeks of transatlantic intelligence efforts, but would not be releasing his identity.

A western Muslim recruit with a British accent, Jihadi John is one of the most hunted terrorists in the world, and is said to have acquired a position of seniority within the terror group for his allegiance to them. He has been made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS 'wilayat', or province.

While British converts are usually used as foot soldiers, Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and has six other British terrorists with him who serve as his bodyguards.

Aged between 28 and 31, he was named as Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a rapper from Maida Vale, west London. Fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, he first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

In September, his father, Adel Abdul Bary, 54, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in relation to al-Qaida's bombing on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,1250,discuss,"BEIRUT (AP) - An Internet video purports to show the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State group.

Sotloff, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syrian in August 2013 until he appeared in a video released online last month by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq.

In the video distributed Tuesday and entitled ""A Second Message to America,"" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter.

A Florida native, Sotloff grew up in Miami. He graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he received a journalism award, according to Manchester TV station WMUR. He went on to attend the University of Central Florida.

Sotloff's mother recently made a video appeal, pleading for the release of her son."
Triple-breasted woman pictured before 'operation' and vows surgery footage will prove third boob is no hoax,2291,discuss,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

Third boob likely a hoax,1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,764,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

Consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Nilesh Sojitra told BuzzFeed News:

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_3863178"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-09-22 10:32:25 -0400', 'update'); });"
Justin Bieber Ringtone Startles Bear,2373,disagree,"Reports of more attacks in Yakutia bears on people 53-year-old Igor Nerungri Vorozhbitsyn ignored, they say, for his life more than once met nose to nose with clumsy and all circuits. So as usual without fear went fishing in the nearby Aldan region. From the road, a man went to the creek to winter quarters where usually stayed fishing. Weapons of a knife on his belt in his hands - rods, behind - the backpack.
To rain at times forced to throw a tight long cloak. A few kilometers left on the old highway. Pereobulsya, Bolotnikov tied to a backpack and walked toward the key Evota to zymes.
Coming in a somewhat macabre silence about three hundred meters, clearly felt that the rear - risk. At the same moment a powerful blow to the backpack knocked him down. Falling, he saw a couple of meters of a huge bear.
Igor himself considerable size, weight under one hundred pounds. But pounce beast with incredible force began to throw it as a toy. Poor fisherman tried to pull a knife, but the bitten hand predator is not obeyed, hanging whip.
What happened next, other than a miracle not to name. Bear attacks in the final chord in the chest and grabbed at the moment mobile fisherman made a sound.
- In the taiga time looked - it was 8:30 pm and put a mobile phone in his breast pocket - recalls that terrible battle Vorozhbitsyn. - I have an older model. Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri. Four hours of operation, and three surgeons literally collected on parched face bloodied pieces Igor. Then - three operations already in the Republican Hospital in Yakutsk. Fortunately, the fisherman left eye was saved. Igor saved and that the first shot hit on the head is not (bear paw easily cut out the skull), and a backpack. Played a protective role and dense coat. Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. But by a happy coincidence did not touch the internal organs and even ribs broken. And if not for mobile ...

Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman.
While doctors saved Igor Vorozhbitsyna hunters looking for a bear attacked him. Evoty literally combed the neighborhood with dogs. And on July 26 shot clumsy 2-3 years old. However, within a few kilometers hunters found more traces of bears. So what killed a man-eating beast or not, no one really can not tell."

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,711,agree,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) — Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.
President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.
Tawil was adopted under a law passed in the 1920s to counteract a legend that a seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.
Under the law, the boys receive presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.
Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.
On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.
The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”
She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.
CORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted."
Transgender teen struck and killed on Ohio interstate in apparent suicide,1138,discuss,"A transgender teenager who committed suicide by walking in front of a tractor trailer in Ohio left a heartbreaking letter in which she blamed her religious parents.

Leelah Alcorn, 17, died in the early hours of Sunday on highway I-71 in Warren County, Ohio, a few miles from her family home.

The high school student left a poignant suicide note accusing her devout Christian parents of refusing to acknowledge her gender and forbidding her from transitioning.

Tragedy: Transgender teenager Leelah Alcorn left a poignant suicide note on her tumblr account, blaming her Christian parents' refusal to acknowledge her gender for her death

The suicide note was posted on Leelah's tumblr account through scheduled publishing just a few hours after her death.

The note begins: 'If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.'

Leelah, from Kings Mill, Ohio, writes that although she was born a boy, she began identifying as a girl at the age of four.

'When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was.

'I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.'

Leelah, 17, was born a boy called Joshua, but despite telling her parents at an early age that she was trans, they replied that she was 'wrong' and sent her to therapy

The 17-year-old high school student wrote in her suicide note that despite identifying as a girl from the age of four, her devout Christian parents refused to allow her to transition

Leelah goes on to reveal that her parents refused to allow her to transition and instead took her to 'Christian therapists' who told her that she was 'selfish and wrong'.

'I formed a sort of a “f*** you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock.

'Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them.

'They wanted me to be their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.'

'On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.'

Leelah then adds: 'I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself.

Local media and Leelah's former high school in Kings Mill have reported on the tragic news using her birth name Joshua.

Leelah's mother Carla Wood Alcorn posted a tribute to her child on her Facebook, but referred to Leelah as her 'son', used her birth name, and made no mention of a suicide.

The disregard for Leelah's wishes to be identified as a girl has angered many in the LGBT community, and a Facebook group calling for Justice for Leelah Alcorn has been set up.

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

I formed a sort of a “f*** you” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school, thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive, my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy, and that’s obviously not what I wanted.

So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.

At the end of the school year, my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media. I was excited, I finally had my friends back. They were extremely excited to see me and talk to me, but only at first. Eventually they realized they didn’t actually give a s**t about me, and I felt even lonelier than I did before. The only friends I thought I had only liked me because they saw me five times a week.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like s**t because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a s**t which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

"ISIS Might Be Harvesting Organs To Finance Operations, Iraqi Envoy Tells UN",1067,discuss,"Islamic State has turned its hand to human organ trafficking to fund terror across the Middle East, it has been claimed.

The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest from a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.

But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria.

Lucrative: The terror organisation even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market

Evil: The jihadist group has until now filled its $2million-a-year war chest through a variety of shadowy sources including oil production, human trafficking and drug smuggling.

The shocking news was revealed in a report by al-Monitor news website, citing an Iraqi ear, nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al-Mosuli.

He told the site that IS commanders have hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in the captured city of Mosul, northern Iraq, that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

It claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market.

'[Al-Mosuli] said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors,' the report's author wrote. 'Information then leaked about organ selling.'

Shocking: But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages - including children - snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria

Black market: The report claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ-smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts, livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market

The report went on: 'Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.'

Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe, the Assyrian International News Agency reported.

While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS' revenue streams, the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the group's $2million annual income.

One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over $8,000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.

Drugs in Europe: IS' drug business has become so successful in recent months that the Russian Federal Drug Control Service claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market

Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitor's report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh, which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (RFDCS) says is generating 'significant revenues.'

Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europe's entire heroin market.

'The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe,' the Russian Federal Drug Control Service issued in a statement.

However, crude oil still remains IS' biggest earner, pulling in more then $1million per day as it is produced from oil refineries captured in besieged towns."
US denies it threatened Foley family,749,agree,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough says no threats were made to the families of slain U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff for considering ransom payments to their captors. McDonough, making the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, said the administration merely explained what the law is regarding such ransom payments: They're prohibited.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""That's our responsibility to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Foley and Sotloff were executed by Islamic State militants, who posted videos of the beheadings on the Internet. Foley's parents said Friday the government threatened them with prosecution if they tried to raise money to pay a ransom for their son, who was kidnapped in 2012.

On CNN's ""State of the Union"" and ABC's ""This Week,"" McDonough pushed President Obama's plan for fighting Islamic State, or ISIS, militants, and urged Congress to fund anti-ISIS groups in Syria. He pledged, however, there is no intention to send U.S. soldiers into the area. Rather, he said, the plan features bolstering local fighting forces.

""It's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL [the way the administration refers to ISIS],"" he said on ""State of the Union.""

On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and ""Fox News Sunday"" McDonough acknowledged the United States is at war with ISIS and called the situation ""complicated.""

""Success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States -- an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq or otherwise,"" McDonough said.

Secretary of State John Kerry, however, said too much emphasis is being put on the use of the word ""war."" On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Kerry said the terminology doesn't matter.

""In terms of al Qaeda, which we have used the word 'war' with, yeah ... we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates. And in the same context if you want to use it, yes, we are at war with ISIL in that sense,"" Kerry said. ""But I think it's waste of time to focus on that. Frankly, lets consider what we have to do to degrade and defeat ISIL.

""What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called the administration's approach ""delusional.""

In a speech Wednesday, Obama said the U.S. would conduct bombing raids on ISIS targets but would not commit combat troops to the fight.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion.

“You cannot create an army to destroy ISIL without an American component. … This is war.”

Gens. Paul Eaton and Jim Dubik said on ""State of the Union"" Obama's plan could work but success will depend on what follows.

""It's not an impossible venture,"" Dubik said."
Meet the 3-boobed woman,2258,discuss,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Dr Mossi Salibian, a member of the hospital’s multidisciplinary breast expert team, said such a procedure would be possible, but mercifully added he didn’t believe any doctor would perform such an operation.

He said: “There are many things that are possible, but that doesn’t mean we would do it.”

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,914,disagree,"Nope. Argentina’s President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has not become godmother of a Jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf – despite what you may have read in multiple news reports.

Over the past few days, the story has been reported and unquestioningly re-reported across the echo chamber of the internet, picked up by news organisations around the world including Haaretz, Buzzfeed, The Independent and The Huffington Post.

Like all good urban myths, the articles were based on a grain of truth: by tradition, the seventh son (or daughter) born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson (or daughter) of the president. Until this month, the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies, but on Wednesday, Iair Tawil – not a baby, but the strapping 21-year old son of a rabbi – became the country’s first Jewish presidential godson.

In her Twitter account, Kirchner described Tawil, 21, as “completely sweet” and lit Hanukkah candles with his family.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew

But somehow, the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón (Argentina’s equivalent to the European werewolf). According to some versions of the myth, the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse.

Evidently, the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colourful myth too good to fact-check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism.

But according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda, there is no link between the two traditions. “The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president,” he said.

That custom began in 1907, when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann, Volga German emigrés from south-eastern Russia asked then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son, said the historian.

“The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia, where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons, and Argentina’s president accepted.”

The practice soon became tradition and was passed into law in 1974 by Isabel Perón, the widow of Argentina’s political strongman General Juan Perón, once she succeeded him in the presidential seat after his death in office. As Argentina’s first woman president, Mrs Perón extended the benefit to seventh daughters as well.“The unconnected myth of the lobizón began among Argentina’s “gauchos,” the cowboys of Argentina’s vast cattle-raising Pampas, adapted from the older European werewolf legends,” said Balmaceda.In the Argentinian version, the lobizón transforms into a mixture of pig and dog every Tuesday and Friday night – not just once every full moon. Unlikely other werewolves of myth, the lobizón transmits its curse not through its bite but by passing between the legs of its unfortunate victims.

In Catholic Argentina, large familes are not uncommon: over 120,000 families had seven of more children at last count in 2006. Not all qualify to become presidential god-children as the honour is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively, with no daughters in between.

The president with most godsons was Juan Perón, who had 1,982 over three terms in office. He is followed by another Peronist former president, Carlos Menem, who had 1,136 during the 1990s. Fernández has become presidential godmother to some 700 children since taking office in 2007. Earlier this year, she set another precedent, by making the the daughter of a lesbian couple the first presidential godchild."
Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2021,discuss,"Joan Rivers. Photo: AP

Joan Rivers' personal doctor reportedly took a selfie with the US comedian while she was under general anaesthetic.

The claim was made by a staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic where Rivers underwent a scheduled endoscopy late last month, according to CNN.

The 81-year-old went into cardiac arrest on the operating table and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital.

The endoscopy procedure was conducted by gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, but CNN cited their source as saying a second doctor entered the room afterwards and performed an unplanned and unauthorised biopsy on Rivers' vocal chords.

That doctor, described only as the comic's personal ear, nose and throat physician, was reportedly not certified by the clinic as required by law.

According to the CNN report, the same source told a state health department investigation into Rivers' death that the doctor first took a selfie with the unconscious star.

They also said the investigators believe Rivers could have suffered the cardiac arrest after the biopsy caused her throat to swell and cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs.

The clinic declined to respond to the comments about a selfie, but last week issued a statement saying ""a biopsy of the vocal cords"" has ever been performed on site.

Patient confidentiality laws prohibited them from specifically referencing Rivers' case.

A couple of days later a spokesperson for the clinic said Dr Cohen was no longer the facility's medical director and was not performing procedures there.

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,2146,agree,"Nowadays, it seems the world is just littered with crises. But one thing we don't have to worry about is ""Crabzilla.""

A photo depicting what appears to be a 50-foot crab hanging out near a wharf in Kent, England, started making the rounds on the Internet earlier this week. The photo was featured on a local curiosities site called Weird Whitstable, and eventually dubbed ""Crabzilla.""

Quinton Winter, who runs the site, told the Daily Express that he'd spotted a giant crab in the mouth of Kent harbor while on vacation with his son last year. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws,"" he said.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbor reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?"" Winter asks on his website.

Experts say neither.

""The idea of a giant 'crabzilla' would [be] very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax,"" Dr. Verity Nye, Ocean and Earth Science researcher at Southampton University, told the Daily Mail. ""I don't know what the currents are like around that harbor or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.""

Spider crabs, the largest known to British waters, grow to about 4 feet and inhabit much deeper waters than the those near the pier where Crabzilla is shown lurking.

Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,1907,disagree,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

"Woman Gets Third Boob Implanted, Wants to Be ""Unattractive to Men""",2335,discuss,"Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

""I saw it coming.""

ISIS Beheads Second American Journalist,2063,discuss,"An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist being held hostage by the militants.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed.

After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.

The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,2486,agree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

She says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

Hessler has gone into hiding since news of Tridevil grabbed national attention.

She was nowhere to be seen at her run down home in one of Tampa's poorer neighborhoods.

And if Hessler really is Tridevil, her 80-year-old grandfather Kenneth appeared not to have any idea about the radical transformation.

Attention grabber? In December 2013, a woman also named Alisha Hessler made national headlines when she alleged that she was attacked outside a nightclub by a man

News maker: Hessler subsequently made the man stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign reading 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. The story made national news

Speaking to MailOnline from his home in North Barrington, Illinois he said: 'We don't know what to believe. We did not know a thing about this'.

While Tridevil claims to have paid $20,000 for the operation, Hessler's rundown home in Tampa suggests someone who has struggled to make ends meet.

A decaying leather sofa had been dumped outside the tile and brick single story home which has rusting iron bars covering the downstairs windows.

Liar: Hessler was also arrested in March 2013 and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'

Broken plastic blinds have been drawn and the front garden is overgrown with weeds.

Neighbors said they hardly saw Hessler.

'She keeps very odd hours,' said one neighbor. 'You'd see her coming in at 6am when I'd be leaving to drive to work. She seemed nice enough but I don't believe her getting another breast. I just saw it on the news and it's fake. She just wants to make a name for herself.'

Other facts of Tridevil's story also don't line up, like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a WTSP reporter this week.

'I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet,' Jasmine said. '[Because] that's also going to be on my show where I'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and I want to save that.'

The only other pictures of her third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged...other than the WTSP footage.

In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs.

Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.

Selfies: The only pictures to emerge of Tridevil's third breast are self made. Tridevil did show her breast, but only very briefly to a WTSP reporter this week. She said she wasn't comfortable showing the breast too long because she wants to save it for her self-produced reality show

Scam? Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler is pictured above in the social media photos. She owns the domain name to JasmineTridevil.com

However, Tridevil claims a surgeon agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate.

Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous.

'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.'

MailOnline's calls to Hessler were not answered Tuesday morning.

Unethical: While the operation to add a third-breast is physical feasible, experts say that no surgeon would agree to carry out such a procedure on someone who may not be mentally well"
Poster girl in fight against ISIS is beheaded by terror group,2527,discuss,"A female Kurdish fighter, who was viewed as an iconic face of the Kurdish resistance movement, has been reportedly beheaded by ISIS.

The woman, known by the nickname ‘Rehana’ became a face of the conflict after a picture of her holding a rifle and making a V sign was posted on Twitter, receiving over 5,000 retweets.

She fought for the Kurdish Women’s Defense Unit and claimed to have killed 100 ISIS militants.

It is now believed that Rehana may have been killed by IS militants after a picture circulated on Twitter, purporting to show her head being held aloft by a member of the jihadist organisation.

Her death has not been confirmed, however, by the Women’s Defense Unit.

She had been fighting to defend Kobane, a Syrian border town which has been under assault by ISIS for more than a month.

More than 10,000 women have helped to defend the town since the establishment of all female combat units in April.

They now reportedly play a major role in fighting against the IS.

Another female Kurdish fighter, who goes by the pseudonym of Afshin Kobani, said that the advancement of ISIS in Syria had forced to her to join the fight in Kobane.

‘I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,’

‘This is our land – our own – and if we don’t do it, who else will?

‘We are just the same as men; there’s no difference,’ she said. ‘We can do any type of job, including armed mobilisation.’"
"50ft crustacean, dubbed Crabzilla, photographed lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable",2245,disagree,"A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent, UK, is proving a great drawcard… for the website that’s claiming it’s a giant crab.

Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UK’s weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it.

But even he couldn’t believe this aerial photograph of a 50-foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour:


Crab, sandbank, or Photoshopping idiot? Picture: Weird Whitstable
So he went to check it out for himself.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’,” Winter said.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

Oh, internet. As great as it would be for this to be genuine, we’re counting down to the hoax bust in 3… 2… 1… but secretly hoping it’s real."
Woman has surgery to get third breast: The three most statistically unlikely pairs of boobs,2486,disagree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,2425,disagree,"Jasmine Tridevil, 21, spent $20,000 for the plastic surgery, she told an Orlando radio station. 'To me it just feels like another boob,' she says. 'The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.'

One of these things is not like the others.

A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself ""unatttractive to men.""

The admittedly ""crazy"" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore.

""Well I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show last week. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Her parents, though, apparently did not take the news in stride.

""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door.""

Hewlett Packard ‘planning to split into two’,1838,discuss,"Hewlett-Packard Co. HPQ +2.00%  plans to break in two, separating its personal-computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, according to people familiar with the matter.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the people said. It is expected to be effected as a tax-free distribution of shares to the company’s stockholders next year, one of the people said.

The move is one H-P and its investors and analysts have long contemplated. It would come amid a wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world, underpinned by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well-received by shareholders—if not actively sought by them.

On Tuesday, online-auction pioneer eBay Inc. EBAY -0.77%  announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBay’s decision, pushing the company’s shares up about 7.5% that day.

In 2012, under current H-P CEO Meg Whitman, H-P reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation.

Ms. Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the separate, so-called enterprise company, one of the people said. Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company, while Dion Weisler, an executive in the PC and printer operation, is to be CEO of that business, this person said.

In fiscal 2013, the printing and personal systems group, as it is known, inked $55.9 billion in revenue, about half the Palo Alto, Calif., company’s total. Sales for the operation dropped 7.1% amid fierce competition, compared with a 6.7% decline for the company as a whole.

Last year, H-P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping to No. 2 behind China’s Lenovo Group Ltd, according to industry research firm IDC.

H-P, famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto 75 years ago, has been undergoing a multiyear restructuring under Ms. Whitman as the company tries to stem sales declines. Aside from the PC and printer business, the rest of H-P’s revenue comes from selling services and hardware such as servers and data-storage systems to corporations, as well as software and financial services.

H-P’s shares have risen sharply since last year, but are still well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached in the 1990s tech boom. H-P shares increased 2% Friday to $35.20, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion.

To combat lower sales and provide lift to its shares, H-P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs.

Ms. Whitman has sought to push H-P further into growth pockets such as cloud software, but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas.

H-P has also been contemplating big strategic changes lately. Over much of the past year, the company held talks to merge with data-storage giant EMC Corp., but those negotiations, which would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly $130 billion, recently ended.

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2357,discuss,"Rivers, 81, had checked in for routine throat procedure in Manhattan

Slipped into cardiac arrest around 9.40am on August 27

City official revealed how paramedics and other rescues came to her side

More than 10 people helped give her CPR, but couldn't revive the star

Rivers was put into a coma, and died on September 4

The doctor performing a biopsy on Joan Rivers’ vocal cord as she went into cardiac arrest allegedly took a selfie photo with the comedian while she was under anesthetic in the procedure room.

The physician hasn't been publicly identified, but is described as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

A member of staff at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators about the doctor's questionable behavior, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.

Death: Joan Rivers, 81, suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure on August 28

Clinic: Rivers was at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, which made the initial 911 call after she went into cardiac arrest

9:40 a.m, August 27: Yorkville Clinic called 911 with reports of a cardiac arrest.

9:45 a.m: The New York Fire Department response team arrives to find CPR underway, and takes over.

9:47 am: An ambulance from Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, arrives and joins in.

9.48am: A second NYFD unit with Emergency Medical Technicians, along with a supervisor, arrive at the clinic.

9:50 am: By this point the number of rescuers totals ten people.

Details of how emergency services responded to the star's unexpected cardiac arrest at a clinic in New York have emerged, allowing a timeline to be constructed of the cardiac arrest, which proved fatal.

Rivers, 81, had checked in for a routine throat procedure at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28, when her condition took a shocking turn for the worse.

She had to be put of life support, and died on September 4, prompting an outpouring of grief from the world of showbusiness.

Now, almost three weeks after the incident, a New York city official has revealed exactly how the different emergency services fought to save her, and that she was surrounded by rescuers within ten minutes.

The official told CNN that the response began with a 911 call from the clinic, which was given the highest priority.

The fire department were first to arrive at the clinic, five minutes after the call.

Medical staff were already trying to give Rivers CPR using a defibrillator and a breathing tube.

The firefighters then took over the attempts to revive her.

Two minutes after the firefighters came, an ambulance arrived at the clinic, whose paramedics helped with the CPR.

Almost immediately after that, another Fire Department vehicle arrived with medical aid, making a total of more than 10 people fighting to save her.

Rivers was taken from the clinic to Mount Sinai hospital in Manhattan, where she later died.

New York health authorities have launched an investigation into her death, amid speculation as to the exact nature of the procedure she was undergoing and who was treating her.

A director of the clinic has also resigned in the wake of the celebrity's death.

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,1624,discuss,"AUSTIN (KXAN) — This giant news is a colossal conundrum. That’s because a photo of a “Crabzilla” has people asking if it could be real, according to AOL. The creature in question: a 50-foot-long crab. The picture is reportedly an aerial image taken in the United Kingdom.

“The aerial shot enables viewers to see the full body of the crab, including its pinchers and legs,” says the AOL article.

The article also mentions a man who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual. He reportedly thought the creature in question was initially driftwood with a striking resemblance to a crab, but then later explained he now thinks the crab is real.

By the way, the largest known crab in the world is the Japanese spider crab. But even that one only measures up to about one-fourth the size of this alleged “Crabzilla.” They can measure 12 feet across from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds."
ISIS terror chief 'believed dead': Iraqi military confirm warlord WAS injured in US-led airstrike as speculation grows feared jihadist perished in attack,2101,discuss,"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hit Saturday during a meeting with militants, though not much is known

Iraqi authorities announced on Sunday that an air strike wounded Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the militant group the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS).

He was hit Saturday in the town of Qaim in Iraq’s Anbar province during a meeting with militant forces, anonymous Iraqi officials told the Associated Press.

The Defense and Interior Ministries of Iraq said in statements that al-Baghdadi was injured, but they did not elaborate on the injury or the air strike. The Pentagon offered no additional information.

Since al-Baghdadi, thought to be in his early 40s, took over the militants in 2010, he has grown it from a local al-Qaeda branch into a powerful, independent Islamist extremist group.

The U.S. and allied forces began launching air strikes against ISIS targets in September.

Third boob likely a hoax,1924,disagree,"A Florida massage therapist said she paid $20,000 for a third breast in hopes of becoming less attractive to men

""I don't want to date anymore,"" Jasmine Tridevil told Orlando's Real Radio 104.1.

Tridevil, 21, has documented her post-surgery life through photos and videos posted to YouTube, Facebook and other social media sites -- mostly images of her posing in custom-made three-cup bikinis and bras.

Her desire to repel the opposite sex with her updated anatomy wasn't her only motivation for the surgery: Tridevil also hopes to have her own show on MTV someday.

She said she contacted more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to perform the operation."
"Woman pays $20,000 for third breast to make herself LESS attractive to men",1454,discuss,"If you thought three-breasted women were a thing of the “Total Recall"" past, you obviously haven’t heard of Jasmine Tridevil.

The 21-year-old Tampa, Fla. resident allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third breast and fake nipple surgically added to her body in hopes of deterring male suitors and earning an MTV reality show. Needless to say, her parents aren’t too thrilled about it.

“My mom ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me,” Tridevil said of her mother’s reaction. Dad’s a little more supportive but still ashamed of his circus-freak-esque daughter.

From a 10-minute radio segment called “The News Junkie,” it’s pretty clear Tridevil was probably never just your average girl. Previously obsessed with Criss Angel, she said she goes to Vegas alone every year for her birthday to see the dark magician. Last year, she bought tickets for the whole first row of seats for his show.

Which leads to one more obvious question. Where does a 21-year-old woman get the $20,000 for a procedure like a third boob? And with Criss Angel’s Vegas tickets going for $59 to $130 right now, purchasing a full row doesn’t come cheap. Tridevil said she’s a licensed massage therapist and saved for two years for the $20,000 implant.

“I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said, which is inconsistent with her purchasing an entire row of Criss Angel tickets. But, hey. Whatever.

Massage therapy isn’t Tridevil’s calling anymore. She’s unhappy and ready to move on to the next step of her life: television.

Tridevil has already gotten her start on her YouTube channel featuring a riveting video about what’s wrong with tewntysomethings and how to get a job.

“When I give you advice, I don’t wanna hear you give me excuses,” she said in the video.

You tell 'em girl.

“My whole dream is to just get this show on MTV,” she said in the interview. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this,” Tridevil said of the reality show she’s currently producing. “So if this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

The shock snap clicked from the air has caused a stir online, with many convinced it shows a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

But others claim the photo is fishy - and is nothing more than a oddly-shaped sandbank or a a bit of image manipulation.

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2466,agree,The third breast story is a hoax.

Hewlett-Packard Plans to Break in Two,1953,agree,"Hewlett-Packard said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.

HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.

Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, rose almost 8 percent in premarket trading on Monday. (Get the latest quote here.)

Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.

The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.

The printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc., will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division.

HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP Inc.

Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.

Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift toward mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.

The announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.

HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses.

Last week online auction company eBay said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

Up to Friday's close, HP's stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year."

And indeed, from the outset many were very suspicious of the authenticity of Tridevil's claims. Snopes.com, the urban legends website, took an in-depth look at her story and concluded the facts decisively pointed to a hoax.

The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday, the Journal said in a report on its web site that cited people familiar with the matter. The division would be made through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year, according to the report.

"ISIS might be harvesting organs, Iraqi ambassador tells UN, amid reports of more hostages being burned alive",2151,discuss,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.

According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."
Hewlett Packard ‘planning to split into two’,1552,discuss,"HP is set to cleave itself in two, splitting off its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. According to The Wall Street Journal, an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. ""Sources familiar with the matter"" tell the paper that current CEO Meg Whitman will become chairman of the PC and printer operation, and will remain CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler will become CEO of the personal computing business — he is currently a high-ranking executive in the division.

This is not the first time talk of splitting HP has surfaced. During some of the company's very tumultuous 2011, reports suggested that executives were close to making the very same decision to split off the enterprise division into its own business. After the departure of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, the company decided to keep the units together under the same corporate umbrella.

The company, based in Palo Alto, has struggled along with the rest of the PC industry as profit margins have slimmed and sales of Windows PC continue to steadily decline. The company's printer business is more lucrative than its PC operation, though the two were combined into the same unit back in 2012. That same year, HP lost the title of top-selling PC manufacturer to Lenovo."
Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2026,disagree,"After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

Meet the 3-boobed woman,764,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

BuzzFeed News has reached out to her for further comment.

update

Consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Nilesh Sojitra told BuzzFeed News:

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_3863178"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-09-22 10:32:25 -0400', 'update'); });"
3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1903,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist in Tampa, Florida, claims that she had a third breast implanted to get famous, land a reality show, and become ""unattractive to men"" because she doesn't ""want to date anymore."" From CBS Tampa Bay:

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

The website reads: ""Crabbing is a popular activity for children during the summer.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbour reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?""

The jury is out on whether the image genuinley does show a giant crustaction and if there really is claws for concern.

Florida woman gets third breast surgically implanted,1924,agree,"A Florida massage therapist said she paid $20,000 for a third breast in hopes of becoming less attractive to men

""I don't want to date anymore,"" Jasmine Tridevil told Orlando's Real Radio 104.1.

Tridevil, 21, has documented her post-surgery life through photos and videos posted to YouTube, Facebook and other social media sites -- mostly images of her posing in custom-made three-cup bikinis and bras.

Her desire to repel the opposite sex with her updated anatomy wasn't her only motivation for the surgery: Tridevil also hopes to have her own show on MTV someday.

She said she contacted more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to perform the operation."
Watch Two Guys Appear to Get Tricked Into Catcalling Their Own Moms,1910,discuss,"One tactic that should prevent overly hormonal street-bros from catcalling women is imagining what their own mothers would think of this behavior. In a new Peruvian ad, however, that threat becomes an all-too-real Freudian nightmare.


Athletics brand Everlast recently teamed up with activist group Paremos el Acoso Callejero (Stop Street Harassment) to teach catcallers on the streets of Lima what their mothers apparently never taught them--by using the people in the world most suited for that very task. In the viral video, which is clearly staged, although it's fun to pretend that it isn't, the Paremos team gets hold of the mothers of area serial harassers and recruits them for a guerrilla mission to end their sons' lives.


These women disguise themselves with dresses, wigs and a copious amount of makeup to go undercover as catcall-bait--and it works to a degree that will alternately delight and horrify. It's probably the funniest possible way to call attention to the fact that 7 out of 10 women on the streets of Peru are sexually assaulted. This dumb video may not be real, but the problem is, and it's a good way to remind potential catcallers of the inherent grossness of their actions."
‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,1741,discuss,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."
Meet the 3-boobed woman,2425,agree,"Jasmine Tridevil, 21, spent $20,000 for the plastic surgery, she told an Orlando radio station. 'To me it just feels like another boob,' she says. 'The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.'

One of these things is not like the others.

A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself ""unatttractive to men.""

The admittedly ""crazy"" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore.

""Well I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show last week. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Her parents, though, apparently did not take the news in stride.

""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door.""

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,1636,agree,"If the bizarre story about Joan Rivers' doctor pausing to take a ""selfie"" in the operating room minutes before the 81-year-old comedienne went into cardiac arrest on August 29 sounded outlandish, that's because it was.
So says Dr Gwen Korovin, Rivers' personal physician who on Thursday night shot down a CNN report claiming Korovin was so star-struck she took the opportunity of her celebrity patient being unconscious to snap a souvenir photo of the two of them together.

CNN, citing sources close to the investigation being carried out by the medical examiner's office, is standing by its claim that a sedated Rivers was clearly visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie - an allegation Korovin's lawyers are calling ""lies"".

Korovin, (known as the ""patron saint of Broadway singers and actors"" for her work tending to the likes of Lady Gaga, Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Celine Dion, Mick Jagger and Luciano Pavarotti) also ""categorically"" denied performing an unauthorised biopsy on Rivers which, according to multiple published reports, caused the heart attack that killed the beloved New Yorker during what should have been a routine medical procedure.

Whatever Rivers would have made of the escalating drama surrounding her mysterious death, those close to her say she would be thrilled by the news that Vanity Fair scribe Leslie Bennetts has been signed to write her biography, due out early next year.

""Joan Rivers' life story was, in every way, a remarkably dramatic roller-coaster ride characterised by triumphant highs and devastating lows, one that is both wildly entertaining and deeply moving,"" Bennetts said in a statement. ""It's hard to imagine a more compelling subject for a book or one that would be more fun."" And lucrative. Within hours of Rivers' death, sales of her latest book (Diary of a Mad Diva) shot up an impressive - and record-breaking - 70,750pc on Amazon.

Garth Brooks seems to think his Irish fans weren't that put out by the Croke Park debacle. In the run-up to his latest seven-performance run, which kicked off in Atlanta on Friday night, the self-effacing singer-songwriter made reference to his cancelled Irish gigs when asked what the secret is behind his ongoing appeal.

""I wish I could explain it: Of course - I'm beautiful, are you kidding me? I'm talented,"" the 52-year-old joked with reporters. ""But I don't get it...If the Garth guy shows up or not, these guys are still going to have the same great time,"" he said, using his Irish fans as a case in point. ""We saw video footage of people in Ireland, at a bar the night we were supposed to be there, singing Friends in Low Places and they were having the time of their lives...

Dowd deals with pot shots

Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Maureen Dowd is on quite a high after learning that she has been cast as the poster girl for a new ""Consume Responsibly"" edible pot publicity campaign.

The 62-year-old New York Times op-ed columnist, who got (unintentionally) stoned last summer while researching a story about Colorado's recent decision to legalise the use of recreational marijuana, doesn't even mind that the pro-pot brigade are making fun of her nightmare experience with cannabis to warn rookies about the dangers of overdosing.

Dowd, who decided to test the benefits of pot with a few bites of a weed-infused chocolate bar wrote about the results (""What could go wrong?"") in a column (titled ""Don't Harsh Our Mellow, Dude"") which was published in June, graphically recalling how - an hour after ingesting the bar, things went haywire.

""I barely made it from the desk to the bed, where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours... I was panting and paranoid, sure that when the room-service waiter knocked and I didn't answer, he'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy,"" she wrote.

""As my paranoia deepened, I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me.""

A medical consultant would later tell Dowd that marijuana candy bars ""are supposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novices,"" a point she used to condemn the marijuana industry for promoting the drug without safety precautions for first-time users.

On Wednesday, the advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) responded to Dowd's criticism by unveiling a giant billboard featuring a red-haired woman (who looks exactly like the writer) obviously worse for wear on a hotel room bed. ""Don't let a candy bar ruin your vacation,"" reads the tagline. ""With edibles, start low and go slow.""

Dowd, who wasn't in the slightest fazed at her likeness or her story being used in the ad said she has her own plans for artwork from the billboard.

""I'm going to make it my Christmas card. Now,"" she said, adding dryly, ""onto gun control."""
‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,998,discuss,"An astonishing image appears to show a giant crab, nearly 50 feet across, lurking in the harbor at Whitstable, Kent, and while some assert that it is a playful hoax, others believe they have found evidence of a genuine aquatic monster.

The aerial image reveals the outline of a crab at the mouth of Kent harbor, yet the size of the animal dwarfs fishing boats on a nearby pier, as the Daily Mail notes. The giant animal is shaped like an edible crab, a species commonly found in British waters, but which only grows to be ten inches across, on average.

People have flocked to the website Weird Whitstable since the image was first posted there, to judge its authenticity for themselves. Quinton Winter, who curates Weird Whitstable, asserted that the image of the giant crab was sent to him by a follower. At first, he believed that it showed only an unusually shaped sand formation, though he is now convinced that there truly is a strange animal lurking in the harbor.

While crabbing with his son in Whitstable harbor last year, Winter claims to have spotted the giant crab near shore, as he related to The Daily Express.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood,’ Winter said. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws… Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

In July of last year, another image emerged, depicting a giant crab lurking underneath a pier.

Another image, said to be taken in July of last year and posted on Winter’s Weird Whitstablog, purports to show a giant, albeit smaller, crab hiding under a pier.

“This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend,” claims Winter’s website, adding “The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways.”

Graphic artist Ashley Austen noted his skepticism of the aerial image while speaking to Kent Online, describing the way in which such a photograph could be easily manufactured.

“The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop,” he said. “All the ‘artist’ had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbor and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look.”

ISIS Reported to Behead Second American,2298,discuss,"The National Security Council says it is ""appalled"" by the apparent beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,"" NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. ""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The NSC's statement came within an hour after ISIL reportedly released a video showing the murder of Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist who had written for Time, Foreign Policy and National Interest. According to the monitoring service SITE Intelligence Group, Sotloff was beheaded in the same manner as James Foley, the photojournalist who was killed last month. The executioner is reportedly the same man who killed Foley and threatened to kill Sotloff in the video released on Aug. 19.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that the White House could not immediately confirm the validity of the video but that ""our thoughts and prayers"" are with the Sotloff family."

Since last November 23 flows through social networks a video of Peru where a clash between two street bullies with their mothers is simulated and already numbers more than three million views on Youtube.

This performance by actors is based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed by mistake to a female relative and expressed ""deep shame"". Another inspiration for starting the campaign was the famous case of harassment suffered by the Peruvian actress Magaly Solier, star of The Empty Nest, while traveling on public transport.

Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,2291,discuss,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

There is no way to confirm if Tridevil’s breast implant is real but she has been gaining thousands of Facebook and Twitter fans since the story broke Monday morning. So: mission accomplished, either way."
Third boob likely a hoax,2258,discuss,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Hewlett-Packard Plans To Break Into Two Companies: Report,1552,discuss,"HP is set to cleave itself in two, splitting off its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. According to The Wall Street Journal, an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. ""Sources familiar with the matter"" tell the paper that current CEO Meg Whitman will become chairman of the PC and printer operation, and will remain CEO of the split-off enterprise business. Dion Weisler will become CEO of the personal computing business — he is currently a high-ranking executive in the division.

This is not the first time talk of splitting HP has surfaced. During some of the company's very tumultuous 2011, reports suggested that executives were close to making the very same decision to split off the enterprise division into its own business. After the departure of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, the company decided to keep the units together under the same corporate umbrella.

The company, based in Palo Alto, has struggled along with the rest of the PC industry as profit margins have slimmed and sales of Windows PC continue to steadily decline. The company's printer business is more lucrative than its PC operation, though the two were combined into the same unit back in 2012. That same year, HP lost the title of top-selling PC manufacturer to Lenovo."
‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,2380,discuss,"The seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer.

He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax

'It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

'Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.'

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,1286,discuss,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kurdish resistance denies ISIS claims that they have beheaded poster girl 'Rehana',1944,discuss,"The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) reportedly beheaded a famous female Kurdish freedom fighter known only as ""Rehana."" The Women Protection Units (YPG) soldier fought against the terrorist group in Kobane, a strategically important border town in Syria near Turkey.
A picture of Rehana making the V-sign became a widely-distributed image online, retweeted over 5,000 times. Reports claimed she killed over 100 Islamic State jihadists single-handedly. But now a picture of a militant holding her head is making the rounds on social media. The death is not confirmed.
Female fighters are essential to the Kurds. The Women Protection Units (YPG) in Kobane are led by Mayass Abdo, who goes by Narin Afrin. All of the female Pershmerga are volunteers and are honored to fight against the terrorists. One such soldier, Dilar Gencxemis, blew herself up outside of Kobane, killing dozens of militants.
Their accomplishments as warriors aside, it is their gender the jihadists fear the most. They believe if they die in jihad, they will be rewarded with 72 virgins in heaven. However, if a woman kills them, the men are denied their virgins.
“These [ISIS] soldiers apparently believed that if they were killed in battle, they went to paradise as long as they were killed by a man,” said Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), who chairs the U.S. House International Relations Committee. “And these female soldiers were communicating their satisfaction with the fact that they had taken the fight to ISIL and had stopped the advance, turned back the advance -- slayed a number of these fighters, who would then run away.”"

She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Nilesh Sojitra told BuzzFeed News:

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_3863178"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-09-22 10:32:25 -0400', 'update'); });"
Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2291,discuss,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

There is no way to confirm if Tridevil’s breast implant is real but she has been gaining thousands of Facebook and Twitter fans since the story broke Monday morning. So: mission accomplished, either way."

This Is The Most Passive-Aggressive Office Battle We've Ever Seen,1945,disagree,"CHICAGO (FOX 32 News) - A frustrated office worker recently called out his colleague for stealing his lunch, prompting a response from the ""sandwich thief"" himself.

The frustrated worker posted a sign on the fridge saying, ""To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (turkey and Swiss with mayo on rye), this is ridiculous. We are full grown adults, not children. Please take responsibility for your actions and stop stealing other people's property!""

The sandwich thief then came back with a response, asking for ransom money for the stolen turkey and Swiss on rye.

""Dear turkey and Swiss on rye, I have your precious sandwich. It's safe. For now. Put 10 dollars on the plate in the fridge or you'll never see it undigested again.""

HR then got involved in the situation and told the alleged thief to give back the sandwich and it won't be investigated.
But it was too late, the sandwich thief already had eaten the coveted lunch! But he didn't get away with it. HR was able to track down the crook.

These Men Catcalling Their Undercover Mothers Is the Best Payback Ever,1716,disagree,"A Peruvian public service announcement making the rounds today captured two men sexually harassing women on the street, only to find out that the victims of their catcalling are their own moms in disguise. Some sites are treating it as if a prankster's hidden camera actually caught a man hollering at his mom's ""tasty panties,"" but if the scene seems totally staged, that's because it was.

The ""Whistling at Your Mom"" ad actually debuted in Peru back in November, on the heels of the viral ""10 Hours Walking as a Woman in New York City"" that made street harassment a worldwide hot topic. The original Spanish-language video has been viewed more than 5 million times. A reuploaded, translated version hit Reddit this week, bringing the PSA to English-speaking audiences.

When the video first debuted, Spanish newspaper El País reported that the whole scene was staged with actors, but the story was ""based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed female relatives by mistake and expressed 'deep shame.'""

According to internet hoax-busting compendium Emergent.info, Peruvian business newspaper Gestion also called the video out as a scripted setup, writing, ""Speaking about the narrative aspect, it is obvious the situations had been staged. We do understand it would be difficult to go with real interactions, but it is also obvious they wanted us to believe they were real, when they're not.""

It's basically a funnier, tamer version of the hoax video from last November that showed men on Hollywood Boulevard trying to take advantage of a ""drunk"" woman. At least the actors knew what they were getting into in this one.

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,893,agree,"Leading invertebrate researcher says ""a hoax is an understatement"" of photograph appearing to show a colossal crustacean basking off the Kent coastline

A fifty-foot crab dwelling somewhere off the English coast is a thing of nightmares.

The shadowy figure of a colossal crustacean, apparently spotted in the murky waters of Whistable, in Kent, dwarfs boats and cars on the pier it lurks besides.

A satellite picture of the so-called crab, aptly dubbed ‘Crabzilla’, has gone viral after first surfacing on Weird Whitstable, a website for the supernatural curated by illustrator Quinton Winter, which deals in “phantoms, mysteries, tall tales, and artefacts”.

The creature is depicted in the coastal town’s harbour, which is a popular spot for children to go crabbing in the summer.

But those suffering from ostraconophobia (that’s fear of shellfish to you and me) needn’t be left gasping for air, because invertebrate expert Paul Clark at the Natural History Museum in London has branded the photo a hoax.

""I had a good giggle about it - it's ridiculous,"" he said, adding that it ""is definitely not real.""

Here's why:

1. The largest crabs in the world are thought to be Japanese spider crabs - also known as Macrocheira kaempferi - which can grow to the size of a small car with an impressive leg span of up to twelve feet. However, these crabs live in deep, cold water around Japan and are a completely different shape.

2. Another huge crab with a more similar shape to the one in the picture is the Tasmanian giant crab, also known as Pseudocarcinus gigas. These are the world's heaviest crabs but they reside in the southern waters of Australia at depths of 20-820 metres.

3. Mr Clark did not think that the crab was a representation of Cancer pagurus, also known as the edible crab, either because of a slightly different shape. And anyway, these tend to only grow to a maximum of 30 centimetres.

4. Instead, he said that the crab looked more to him like a shore crab (Carcinus maenas) - cleverly Photoshopped on to a satellite image. ""A hoax is an understatement. A shore crab gets up to two inches - if you're lucky!"" he said.

5. Internet hoax debunkers have also been on the case, with a user from ThatsNonsense.com pointing out that the the image of the harbour was taken from Bing maps, sans crustacean in the original satellite photograph, of course."

When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,2131,discuss,"No, that is not a joke headline stolen from The Onion. This is actually a thing that happened.

According to The Independent, Argentina's president, President Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a boy named Yair Tawil as her godson so that he would not turn into a werewolf. It's actually part of a longstanding tradition in the country that dates back to a folk story in the country:

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobison"". The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.
Because some people actually believed this hundreds of years ago, they started killing babies. So, to stop that from happening, presidents starting adopting the seventh born boys of families. The practice was later extended to include girls, too. Now, seventh born children not only get the country's president as their new godparent, they also get a gold medal and a scholarship.

According to The Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Tawil is also the first Jewish boy to participate in the adoption tradition:

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.

On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvelous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther."""
Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,1851,disagree,"Although Joan Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure, her time spent there was anything but routine.

As RadarOnline.com has previously reported, Rivers’ female ear, nose and throat doctor stepped in once Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Rivers’ gastroenterologist, discovered something on her vocal cords. The ENT, who wasn’t authorized to perform any medical procedures at the clinic, took over and began a biopsy.

The biopsy was not authorized, as Rivers never signed a consent form. And once it began, her vocal cords began to swell, Anderson 360 revealed Tuesday night. But that’s not all. Not only was the ENT not supposed to be treating the comedienne, 81, at this time, medical staffers have also told investigators that the ENT snapped a selfie with the Fashion Police star while she was under anesthesia – a major violation of privacy, given she did not give her consent to have her picture taken.

Dr. Cohen, who doubled as the clinic’s medical director, has since parted ways with Yorkville. The clinic confirmed his departure, stating, Dr. Cohen “is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.

The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions.

Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.

""I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports,"" he said.

""If there is a video that's been released, it's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity."""
ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,2289,discuss,"Updated 5:09 a.m. Wednesday:

U.S. officials say the video showing the beheading of a second U.S. journalist by militants of the Islamic State is authentic. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement Wednesday.

Original Post:

An Islamic radical group released a video on Tuesday that purportedly shows the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had threatened Sotloff's life when it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

At the time, the militants said Sotloff's life depended on the actions of the U.S. government, which has been targeting the group with airstrikes to stop its offensive in Iraq.

SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, posted a version of the video showing a man who looks like Sotloff kneeling next to a masked fighter holding a knife.

In his regular briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family and those who worked with him,"" Earnest said. ""The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff.""

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. would try to authenticate the video quickly.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act,"" she said.

Just last week, Sotloff's mother released an emotional video in which she pleaded with the Islamic State to spare her son's life.

Shirley Sotloff asked Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to grant her son amnesty, ""to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad who protected people of the Book.""

According to The Washington Post, Sotloff, 31, was a freelance journalist covering the civil war in Syria when he was captured in 2013. On his Twitter account, Sotloff described himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami,"" whose work has been published in Time and Foreign Policy.

Sotloff's mother said he was ""an honorable man"" who ""has always tried to help the weak.""

The New York Times reports that in the video released today, Sotloff says he is ""paying the price"" for the Obama administration's airstrikes in Iraq.

A masked fighter, the Times reports, appears beside Sotloff saying, ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.""

SITE Intel Group reports that the masked fighter also threatens to execute an additional hostage."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1617,agree,The woman who claimed she had a third breast has been proved a hoax.
"Woman pays $20,000 for third breast to make herself LESS attractive to men",746,discuss,"You won’t believe this one.

According to Buzzfeed, a young woman from Tampa, Fla., has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on “Inside Edition” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But so far at least that part of her story isn't panning out.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, wrote on Facebook: “So I'm flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

But Kimmel is famous for online pranks, including a viral video called ""Worst twerk fail EVER,"" purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident, that turned out to be staged by his show.

HEALTH: Purported third-breast add raises medical, ethical questions

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.

Well, she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another ""Total Recall"" remake.

The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,1286,discuss,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

We think you’ll agree Leeb’s prosthetics are pretty convincing – could it be that Tridevil simply followed suit and hasn’t been under the knife after all?"
"""When We Felt Threatened, We Opened Umbrellas and Raised Our Hands""",1879,discuss,"Rumors swirled over the weekend that demonstrators in Hong Kong were using the “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.

On Sunday, Vox published a story headlined, “Hong Kong’s protesters are using the same ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ gesture used in Ferguson.”

While the article did note that “it’s impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson,” it concluded contending that “it’s fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there.”

Other similar stories followed soon after. MSNBC published an article Monday titled, “In Hong Kong, protesters say ‘hands up, don’t shoot!’” The Daily Mail published a story saying that protesters in Hong Kong had copied the gesture used by U.S. demonstrators.

But, a story in Quartz Sunday appeared to challenge the idea that the gesture used by Hong Kong demonstrators was linked to Ferguson.

According to the story, the gesture used by those in Hong Kong was not a deliberate show of solidarity:

Most Hong Kong protesters aren’t purposefully mimicking “hands up, don’t shoot,”as some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.

Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, “I don’t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.” Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, with the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that “Hong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.” (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)

The Washington Post followed up Monday with a similar analysis:

Sunday, Max Fisher wrote a story for Vox.com arguing that the ‘hands up don’t shoot’ gesture had spread from protests in Ferguson to the pro-democracy demonstrations on the streets of Hong Kong. However, another writer at Quartz.com, who has actually interviewed protesters, says that this is wrong. The evidence seems to show that the gesture had probably not in fact ‘spread’ as Fisher and other commentators believed. Instead, the activists organizing the protests appear to have independently chosen to hold their hands up to emphasize their peaceful intentions to police.

Vox later corrected their post, addressing the controversy.

“Still, Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use, even if only subconsciously,” their story now argues.

This Third Boob Is Probably Only Real in Our Hearts,2466,agree,The third breast story is a hoax.
Here's What We Know About ISIS's Alleged Organ Harvesting Operation,2151,discuss,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.
Author Nassir al-HassounPosted December 5, 2014
TranslatorSteffi Chakti
Original Article اقرا المقال الأصلي باللغة العربية
According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."
Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,1617,agree,The woman who claimed she had a third breast has been proved a hoax.
Meet the 3-boobed woman,1490,disagree,"Jasmine Tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob, but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff. Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible, it is not plausible.

""[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” Dr. Matthew Schulman, a board-certified plastic surgeon in New York, told the Daily Dot. “I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.""

There are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevil’s story. The first is the photographic “evidence” of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered, the Daily Dot wrote.

Second, creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required.

When asked about her surgery, Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She didn’t mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery.

The final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevil’s third breast is fake was the final result. “This technique would create a tight, round breast in the center of the chest,” he said. “Also, all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft, pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast, and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure.”

During a radio interview, Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a “striking” resemblance to Alisha Hessler, the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVIL.com is registered.

Hessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her, Snopes wrote. She reportedly made a man hold a sign that said “I beat women.” She withdrew her complaint with the police department after she was asked for details about the alleged attack, Buzzfeed wrote.

Tridevil said on her Facebook account Tuesday Alisha Hessler is her real name. She also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone else’s identification to get into a club. “I was underage and wanted to get drunk lol,” she wrote.

She told The Sun her claim is not a hoax and her film crew recorded her procedure. She said she will release the footage when she gets a reality television show and “I really don’t care what people say about me.”

3-Boobed Woman a Fake,1244,agree,"The Tampa, Fla. woman who claimed to have had plastic surgery to add a third breast is fake, according to TMZ.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, was reportedly discovered to have faked the plastic surgery after TMZ obtained a police report filed by Tridevil after her bag was stolen at Tampa International Airport.

TMZ reports that the bag was stolen off of an American Airlines conveyor belt and a ""3 breast prosthesis"" was found inside by police after they recovered the bag.

Buzzfeed initially reported the woman's strange look landed her appearances on ""Inside Edition"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" but FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

The Story of the 3-Boobed Lady Is As Fake As Her Third Boob,1741,discuss,"A Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil figured out that there is really only one acceptable reason to get a third breast: to buck traditional beauty standards and purposely make yourself unattractive to men.

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,"" Tridevil said on a recent radio broadcast. ""Because I don’t want to date anymore.""

Given the fact that most men love boobs, I'm not entirely sure getting another one is the fastest route to unattractiveness, but her attempted commitment to misandry is commendable. Meanwhile, the photos look kinda 'shopped, so I'm really hoping this isn't some sort of viral marketing scheme for a Total Recall reboot."
‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,2270,disagree,"After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil, 21, of Tampa had allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself ""unattractive to men,"" we've heard whispers in the wind (and read stories) that this Third Boob is a stunt, a hoax. It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...

Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as ""FALSE,"" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page, Tridevil's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body.

Trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night, where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another, longer look, Tridevil declined, telling the reporter, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Yes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.

Last year, Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading ""I BEAT WOMEN, HONK IF I'M A SCUMBAG"" in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident, but she apparently refused all the calls.

And in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.

Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:

This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.

And Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, ""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.""

So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the ""truth."" But the truth is, we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.

Woman Gets Third Boob to Appear Unattractive to Men,2183,discuss,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

Saudi Airlines to ban gender-mixing seating,1691,discuss,"Saudi Arabia still doesn’t know what year it is.

Saudi Arabia’s national airline, Saudia is allegedly considering seating male and female passengers apart from each other, according to Emirates247. The airline has cited complaints from male passengers who don’t like unknown men being seated next to their wives when they fly. Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd said, “There are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.” The airline will supposedly begin having airport staff assign separate seating for men and women, unless they are closely related.

It’s not only Muslims that are concerned over seating assignments, but also Orthodox Jews. An El Al Airlines flight in September from New York to Israel was delayed because some men refused to be seated next to women…

According to a post on Mashable, a marketing manager for the airline is denying their plans to segregate passengers. However, we should be cautions here — companies often deny they’re working on a new product or procedure, and then all of a sudden it’s introduced as a “surprise.”"

But the airline does employ women of other nationalities.

Many Saudi women require approval from a male guardian before they can travel or work outside the home.

Since last November 23 flows through social networks a video of Peru where a clash between two street bullies with their mothers is simulated and already numbers more than three million views on Youtube.



Under the slogan Sílbale your mother , the sports brand Everlast and the organization Stop Street Harassment -the first Latin American Observatory against acoso- recorded a mockumentary in which pretended to have identified bullies then contact their mothers, you change their look and make it happen where their children were.

This performance by actors is based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed by mistake to a female relative and expressed ""deep shame"". Another inspiration for starting the campaign was the famous case of harassment suffered by the Peruvian actress Magaly Solier, star of The Empty Nest, while traveling on public transport. ""I'm cholera in Peru not put a stop to sexual harassment in the public media. The rapist has more rights than the victims,"" ​​said the actress after the incident last May.

Meet the 3-boobed woman,1618,disagree,"Did a woman claiming to have a third breast play a hoax on us?

ISIS Reported to Behead Second American,1499,discuss,"The Islamic State (IS) has reportedly beheaded U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the second execution of an American journalist in the past two weeks.

Sotloff’s life was threatened in the same video released in August in which freelance journalist James Foley was behaded by an IS militant.

According to the New York Times, SITE Intelligence Group —a Jihadist threat-monitoring service —said Tuesday IS released a 2:46 min video showing Sotloff’s murder.


Global News has not seen the purported video, but is working to confirm details.

Sotloff’s mother, Shirley Sotloff, made a video plea last week asking IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to spare her son’s life.

“As a mother, I ask your justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad, who protected People of the Book. I want what every mother wants, to live to see her children’s children, I plead with you to grant me this.”

Sotloff, 31, disappeared in Syria in Aug. 2013, while covering the civil war in the country.

IS uploaded a video to YouTube on Aug. 19 showing the beheading of 40-year-old Foley, who had been held hostage since Nov. 2012.

The militant group demanded a $132-million ransom for Foley’s release, among other conditions.

In the same video, Sotloff was seen kneeling in front of an IS militant, who said, “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”"
Crabzilla,2023,discuss,"Debate is raging online as to whether pic shows super-sized snapper of the Kent coast could be the biggest ever to grace UK shores

Is this Britain's biggest crab caught on camera?

The shock snap clicked from the air has caused a stir online, with many convinced it shows a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

But others claim the photo is fishy - and is nothing more than a oddly-shaped sandbank or a a bit of image manipulation.

The 'super crab' picture shows the harbour at Whitstable, Kent. And the unexplained 'creature of the deep' dwarfs fishing boats left on the nearby pier

The pic appeared on the website Weird Whitstable - a collection of the strange put together by Quinton Winter.

Weird Whitstable   Claws for concern: Is this picture shared on the internet the biggest crab the banks of Britain have ever seen?

He told the Daily Express that he saw the mega-crab last summer.

Quinton said: ""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood'.

""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

""Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

The world's largest recorded crab is the Japanese spider crab, a species which can grow to around 12ft and weigh up to three stone.

ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,2289,discuss,"Updated 5:09 a.m. Wednesday:

U.S. officials say the video showing the beheading of a second U.S. journalist by militants of the Islamic State is authentic. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement Wednesday.

Original Post:

An Islamic radical group released a video on Tuesday that purportedly shows the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had threatened Sotloff's life when it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

At the time, the militants said Sotloff's life depended on the actions of the U.S. government, which has been targeting the group with airstrikes to stop its offensive in Iraq.

SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, posted a version of the video showing a man who looks like Sotloff kneeling next to a masked fighter holding a knife.

In his regular briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family and those who worked with him,"" Earnest said. ""The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff.""

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. would try to authenticate the video quickly.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act,"" she said.

Just last week, Sotloff's mother released an emotional video in which she pleaded with the Islamic State to spare her son's life.

Shirley Sotloff asked Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to grant her son amnesty, ""to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad who protected people of the Book.""

According to The Washington Post, Sotloff, 31, was a freelance journalist covering the civil war in Syria when he was captured in 2013. On his Twitter account, Sotloff described himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami,"" whose work has been published in Time and Foreign Policy.

Sotloff's mother said he was ""an honorable man"" who ""has always tried to help the weak.""

The New York Times reports that in the video released today, Sotloff says he is ""paying the price"" for the Obama administration's airstrikes in Iraq.

A masked fighter, the Times reports, appears beside Sotloff saying, ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.""

SITE Intel Group reports that the masked fighter also threatens to execute an additional hostage."
When Photos Lead a Protest,1514,discuss,"What began as an Occupy-inspired student sit-in exploded in Hong Kong over the weekend as police responded with excessive force toward peaceful demonstrators, using tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. The Occupy Central protests spread from Hong Kong’s financial district to just outside the city’s government offices in Admiralty, but the law-enforcement crackdown had the opposite effect, sending thousands more into the streets in solidarity and shutting down portions of the city. The protests have now bled into the work week and riot police have pulled back, at least for now. Here’s what you need to know so far.

What started this?

After 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, but has operated semi-autonomously under what’s known as “one country, two systems,” outside of Beijing’s communist rule. The promise was that in 2017, Hong Kong would be allowed, for the first time, to elect its own leader (known as chief executive) in democratic elections, instead of having the slot filled by a committee from Beijing. But earlier this summer, China decided a committee was still necessary, and it would select the candidates for Hong Kong’s 2017 elections. Outrage has been building ever since.

Who’s out there?

The protests were organized in part by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, which has since called for an indefinite student strike, the New York Times reports. Young people are everywhere, but not alone. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union has joined them with a general strike, as have some professionals after the weekend violence — “office workers in slacks and dress shirts mixed with crowds of students in black T-shirts,” according to the Times.

Occupy Central with Love and Peace, meanwhile, is led by a University of Hong Kong law professor named Benny Tai, Businessweek reported earlier this summer. Tai has been organizing for months, and a look at his planning from June now serves as some serious foreshadowing:

At some point, Tai says the movement may follow through on the threat in its name and occupy Central, where most of Hong Kong’s top banks and other financial institutions (as well as Bloomberg) have their offices. Many companies are already taking no chances, developing plans in case demonstrators block the streets and prevent employees from getting to work.

What do they want?

In addition to democratic elections in 2017 and continued autonomy for Hong Kong, as previously promised, protesters are now demanding the resignation of current chief executive Leung Chun-ying. The economics are also less than ideal, and the country could be slipping into a recession.

How is the government reacting?

Not well, especially at first. Here’s a video from the ground of protesters being teargassed, in attacks that look familiar from Ferguson and helped stoke outrage among citizens:

The use of pepper spray has been equally alarming, and is reminiscent of previous Occupy protests in the U.S.

Hong Kong police officer grabs elderly protester, turns and pepper sprays them full in the face: http://t.co/5l0pFtGGTF

As Vox notes, some protesters have taken to using the “hands up, don’t shoot” imagery of the Michael Brown demonstrations in Ferguson. It’s still a powerful image on the other side of the world:

.@attorneycrump Will you please show this to #MikeBrown's parents &let them know that he changed the WORLD! #HongKong pic.twitter.com/3u4FOSnp7x

Protesters in Ferguson have sent a message back:

Heather, a #Ferguson protester, wearing a sign that says ""Stay strong #HongKong."" pic.twitter.com/9CnqFfERfL

It’s not surprising, then, that Beijing is blaming the West for stoking tensions. From the Times:

A commentary on the website of the People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s main newspaper, claimed that the upheavals in Hong Kong were instigated by democratic radicals who had sought support from “anti-China forces” in Britain and the United States, and had sought lessons from independence activists in Taiwan. It called them a “gang of people whose hearts belong to colonial rule and who are besotted with ‘Western democracy’.”

Hong Kong has canceled its annual fireworks celebration of China’s National Day on Wednesday, indicating that this thing may continue for the foreseeable future.

“The protesters, they are so young,” a mother of two who joined the protests on Monday told the Times. “They are fighting for our future, for my children’s future.”"
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1903,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist in Tampa, Florida, claims that she had a third breast implanted to get famous, land a reality show, and become ""unattractive to men"" because she doesn't ""want to date anymore."" From CBS Tampa Bay:

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

Here is Jasmine Tridevil's Twitter.

A 21-year-old Florida woman says she spent $20,000 for a third breast to make herself ""unatttractive to men.""

The admittedly ""crazy"" massage therapist, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, told an Orlando radio station in a bizarre interview that she had the plastic surgery because she doesn't want to date anymore.

""Well I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show last week. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Iraq’s ambassador urges UN to investigate claims Isis is harvesting organs: ‘We have bodies - it is clear they are missing certain parts',2151,discuss,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.
Author Nassir al-HassounPosted December 5, 2014
TranslatorSteffi Chakti
Original Article اقرا المقال الأصلي باللغة العربية
According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."
Hewlett-Packard Plans To Break Into Two Companies: Report,745,discuss,"HP's home-focused and business divisions have frequently seemed at odds with each other, and apparently the company agrees. The Wall Street Journal claims that the tech giant is about to split into two companies, one focused on PCs and the other dedicated solely to corporate hardware and services. If the report is accurate, the separation could be announced as early as Monday. The exact reasoning behind the move hasn't been mentioned, but the PC-centric group would be headed by one of its existing executives, Dion Weisler; current CEO Meg Whitman would run the business group and keep an eye on the other company by serving as its chairman of the board. However true the rumor may be, such a move wouldn't be all that surprising -- much of the computing industry has been restructuring and rescaling to cope with a world where the PC's role is rapidly evolving.

‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,1624,discuss,"AUSTIN (KXAN) — This giant news is a colossal conundrum. That’s because a photo of a “Crabzilla” has people asking if it could be real, according to AOL. The creature in question: a 50-foot-long crab. The picture is reportedly an aerial image taken in the United Kingdom.

“The aerial shot enables viewers to see the full body of the crab, including its pinchers and legs,” says the AOL article.

The article also mentions a man who runs a website devoted to the weird and unusual. He reportedly thought the creature in question was initially driftwood with a striking resemblance to a crab, but then later explained he now thinks the crab is real.

By the way, the largest known crab in the world is the Japanese spider crab. But even that one only measures up to about one-fourth the size of this alleged “Crabzilla.” They can measure 12 feet across from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds."
James Foley's mother 'appalled' by U.S. government handling of case,749,disagree,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough says no threats were made to the families of slain U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff for considering ransom payments to their captors. McDonough, making the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, said the administration merely explained what the law is regarding such ransom payments: They're prohibited.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""That's our responsibility to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Foley and Sotloff were executed by Islamic State militants, who posted videos of the beheadings on the Internet. Foley's parents said Friday the government threatened them with prosecution if they tried to raise money to pay a ransom for their son, who was kidnapped in 2012.

On CNN's ""State of the Union"" and ABC's ""This Week,"" McDonough pushed President Obama's plan for fighting Islamic State, or ISIS, militants, and urged Congress to fund anti-ISIS groups in Syria. He pledged, however, there is no intention to send U.S. soldiers into the area. Rather, he said, the plan features bolstering local fighting forces.

""It's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL [the way the administration refers to ISIS],"" he said on ""State of the Union.""

On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and ""Fox News Sunday"" McDonough acknowledged the United States is at war with ISIS and called the situation ""complicated.""

""Success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States -- an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq or otherwise,"" McDonough said.

Secretary of State John Kerry, however, said too much emphasis is being put on the use of the word ""war."" On CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Kerry said the terminology doesn't matter.

""In terms of al Qaeda, which we have used the word 'war' with, yeah ... we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates. And in the same context if you want to use it, yes, we are at war with ISIL in that sense,"" Kerry said. ""But I think it's waste of time to focus on that. Frankly, lets consider what we have to do to degrade and defeat ISIL.

""What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called the administration's approach ""delusional.""

In a speech Wednesday, Obama said the U.S. would conduct bombing raids on ISIS targets but would not commit combat troops to the fight.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion.

“You cannot create an army to destroy ISIL without an American component. … This is war.”

Gens. Paul Eaton and Jim Dubik said on ""State of the Union"" Obama's plan could work but success will depend on what follows.

""It's not an impossible venture,"" Dubik said."
Third boob likely a hoax,889,agree,"Tampa, Florida -- Jasmine Tridevil had made international headlines by posting pictures and videos claiming she got a third breast implanted into the center of her chest.

The Tampa massage therapist even spoke with 10 News reporter Charles Billi and said it was legit.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" she said.

And indeed, from the outset many were very suspicious of the authenticity of Tridevil's claims. Snopes.com, the urban legends website, took an in-depth look at her story and concluded the facts decisively pointed to a hoax.

And now perhaps the final piece of evidence: 10 News has received an an incident report from Tampa International Airport, where earlier this month Tridevil (real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler) reported her baggage had been stolen.

The luggage was eventually recovered and two people were arrested for stealing several bags off of the airport conveyor belts. When Tridevil went to retrieve her recovered items, a property receipt was written that listed the contents contained within:

Woman has third breast implanted,746,discuss,"You won’t believe this one.

According to Buzzfeed, a young woman from Tampa, Fla., has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on “Inside Edition” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

But so far at least that part of her story isn't panning out.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, wrote on Facebook: “So I'm flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

But Kimmel is famous for online pranks, including a viral video called ""Worst twerk fail EVER,"" purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident, that turned out to be staged by his show.

HEALTH: Purported third-breast add raises medical, ethical questions

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV.

Well, she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another ""Total Recall"" remake.

“My whole dream is to get this show on MTV,” she said.

“I’m dumping every penny I have into this. If this doesn’t work, I’m through.”

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,2522,agree,"The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish godson – to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.

Although this sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel, the President last week met Yair Tawil and his family for the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years and is based on Argentinian folklore.

According to the legend, the seventh son of a family will transform into ‘El Lobison’, a werewolf like creature, on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th Birthday, and will continue to turn into a blood-thirsty, baby eating werewolf every full moon.

The fear of the creature was so fervent in 19th century Argentina that many families murdered or abandoned their seventh born son, forcing the Argentinian government to implement the process of Presidential adoption.

The tradition was established in 1907, and was extended to baby girls in 1973.

Although having seven children is now much rarer than 100 years ago, seventh sons or daughters can now expect to gain the President as their official godparent, as well as a gold medal and educational scholarship.

The President has said that Yair is the first Jewish boy to take part in the ceremony, as the tradition was exclusive to Catholic children until 2009."
This Is The Most Passive-Aggressive Office Battle We've Ever Seen,1005,disagree,"The stand-off between an office worker, known only as 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' and their colleague, 'Sandwich Thief' has become an internet hit

This office note battle between a cheeky sandwich thief and their jobsworth nemesis might just be the funniest thing you read all day.

If you've ever worked in an office, you'll be familiar with those who are possessive about their lunch and partial to a passive-aggressive note.

And if those people annoy you, this funny note war should give you a giggle.

The battle breaks out when someone has a sandwich stolen from the office fridge.

Clearly irked, they leave their light-fingered a note, telling them to stop stealing.

And the subsequent string of letters between the two doesn't disappoint.

Check out the hilarious exchanges between the two below.

This Woman Claims To Have Had Plastic Surgery To Have A Third Breast,2026,discuss,"After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

Islamic state issues video of beheading of U.S. hostage: SITE,363,discuss,"Freelance journalist Steven Sotloff has reportedly been executed by ISIS, Lee Ferran reported Tuesday for ABC News.

In the video, which appeared online today, Sotloff addresses the camera, saying, “I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing.”
“Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?” Sotloff says calmly as the black clad militant holds a knife casually at his side.
On August 27, Sotloff’s mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading for her son’s release, Zeke Miller reported for Time. On August 22, Rick Gladstone and Shreeya Sinha wrote about Sotloff for The New York Times.

Described by friends as selfless, Mr. Sotloff spent most of his life in Florida except when he attended a boarding high school, Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he apparently developed a penchant for reporting and writing. He coedited the student newspaper, The Kimball Union, graduated in 2002 and attended the University of Central Florida, where he played rugby, worked for the independent student newspaper, Central Florida Future, and expressed deep interest in travel to the Middle East.
He left after three years and, soon after, began to pursue journalism full-time.
Last month, freelance journalist James Foley was executed by ISIS."
‘Three-boobed’ woman: They’re not fake,2335,discuss,"Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

""I saw it coming.""

Florida woman gets third breast surgically implanted,764,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) is a young lady from Tampa, Florida.

Here is a troubling radio interview with her about why she allegedly got a third breast a few months ago and how hard it was to get one. She said that she was told to “sign a nondisclosure agreement” and had to call scores of doctors before she could find one who would do it because it was such a breach of ethics. She didn’t reveal the name of the doctor who performed the procedure.

Over the course of the interview, during which the hosts asked some unbelievably inappropriate questions, she said the surgery cost $20,000, that she saved up for two years so that it could happen, that her mum won’t talk to her and won’t let her sister talk to her, and that her dad is unhappy. She said it’s not just about fame.

On the station, the 21-year-old said: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

She said a “mini-implant” was put in so it had a nipple, and an areole was tattooed around it. The breasts apparently don’t quite “match up”.

She told the station: “The reaction has been crazy.”

It’s not entirely unsurprising. Thus far she seems to be enjoying the attention, writing on her Facebook page, “So I’m flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday! Then going to be on the news, Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine! oh and a few radio shows!”

BuzzFeed News has reached out to her for further comment.

update

Consultant plastic surgeon and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Nilesh Sojitra told BuzzFeed News:

“This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_3863178"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-09-22 10:32:25 -0400', 'update'); });"
Meet the 3-boobed woman,2292,agree,"A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

ISIS Reported to Behead Second American,1309,discuss,"The United States government said early Wednesday that the video showing the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff at the hands of an Islamic State militant is authentic.

According to the Twitter page run by President Barack Obama's National Security Council:

The US Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing US citizen Steven Sotloff & reached judgment it is authentic.

— @NSCPress (@NSCPress) September 3, 2014

The video, which was discovered on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, showed Sotloff being beheaded in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to the slaying, Sotloff was shown kneeling on the ground and wearing orange clothing, a scene that was reminiscent of the Islamic State murder of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

The masked militant on the video warned President Barack Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, ""our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" He also threatened the life of David Haines, a British citizen and aid worker, who was kidnapped in March 2013.

Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelancer for Time magazine and Foreign Policy, was abducted in 2013 while covering the civil war in Syria.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Sotloff's murder a ""despicable crime,"" the BBC News reported.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement Wednesday, calling the killing of Sotloff ""unfathomable"" and ""an act of medieval savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.""

""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took,"" he said. ""And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.""

Islamic militants are believed to be holding several more journalists in captivity, most of them Syrian reporters."
Crabzilla,2245,discuss,"A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent, UK, is proving a great drawcard… for the website that’s claiming it’s a giant crab.

Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UK’s weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it.

But even he couldn’t believe this aerial photograph of a 50-foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour:


Crab, sandbank, or Photoshopping idiot? Picture: Weird Whitstable
So he went to check it out for himself.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’,” Winter said.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

Oh, internet. As great as it would be for this to be genuine, we’re counting down to the hoax bust in 3… 2… 1… but secretly hoping it’s real."
Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,2291,discuss,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

There is no way to confirm if Tridevil’s breast implant is real but she has been gaining thousands of Facebook and Twitter fans since the story broke Monday morning. So: mission accomplished, either way."
ISIS Reportedly Executes 2nd American Journalist,1886,discuss,"American hostage Steven Sotloff has reportedly been executed by jihadist terrorists. There was no immediate confirmation of the video.

Sotloff, 31, disappeared while reporting in Syria in August 2013. His apparent kidnap was not widely reported until he appeared on a video released last month by the Isil.

In the footage a masked militant beheads US reporter James Foley then parades Mr Sotloff, warning he will meet the same fate unless US President Barack Obama ends air strikes against the group in Iraq.

More to follow."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,785,agree,"She made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as Tampa Bay’s 10 News revealed Tridevil, whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three-breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on Sept. 16.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prosthesis.”

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumor site Snopes also discovered that her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone to whom Tridevil bears a striking resemblance.

However, when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be skeptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Photo: FaceookTridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 to 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for.”

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn agreed that while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely that anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip, Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple,” which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” on her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different … that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre-surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

It’s not the first time Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after he made unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges, she offered her attacker an ultimatum, telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women.’”

The ISIS Executioner Who Killed 4 Hostages May Have Been Wounded In Airstrikes,2057,discuss,"Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office.

The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday.

The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets.

The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq

‘We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them,’ a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday.

This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq.

The Foreign Office spokesman added: ‘We have a number of sources of information coming in.

‘The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don’t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.’

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ‘We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.’ A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

But until now, Jihadi John’s presence at the meeting has not emerged.

It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present.

The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present.

Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff

Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left

According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was ‘the one who slaughtered the journalists’.

It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.

IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosque’s loudspeakers, appealing for the town’s residents to donate blood at the hospital.

Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes.

The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regime’s 17th Division and 93rd Brigade.

Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left

Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal

Jihadi John has become one of the world’s most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.

Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.

Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS ‘wilayat’, or province.

IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.

Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.

He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured

The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards.

In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed.

Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to ‘erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere’.

The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturday’s attack.

The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leader’s house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property.

It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured

Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim.

He said: ‘A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.’

The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria.

It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured.

Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.

Also dead is a prominent IS fighter from Chechnya called Abu Abdul Rahman Al-Shishani, says the document."
UK looking into reports IS beheading suspect wounded,1932,discuss,"The Islamic State (IS) executioner was said to have “narrowly escaped death” when jets bombed a meeting of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town

Jihadi John, the British terrorist who beheaded two British and two American hostages, has been “injured” in an airstrike, according to reports.

The Islamic State (IS) executioner was said to have “narrowly escaped death” when jets bombed a meeting of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town.

The joint US and Iraqi airstrikes are thought to have taken place last Saturday on an area close to the Syrian border.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are aware of the reports but we cannot confirm these reports.”

They declined to give any detail of the reports or where they originated.

According to the Mail on Sunday, quoting a nurse, Jihadi John and other wounded ISIS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

‘Crabzilla’ spotted off the coast of Britain,2146,disagree,"Nowadays, it seems the world is just littered with crises. But one thing we don't have to worry about is ""Crabzilla.""

A photo depicting what appears to be a 50-foot crab hanging out near a wharf in Kent, England, started making the rounds on the Internet earlier this week. The photo was featured on a local curiosities site called Weird Whitstable, and eventually dubbed ""Crabzilla.""

Quinton Winter, who runs the site, told the Daily Express that he'd spotted a giant crab in the mouth of Kent harbor while on vacation with his son last year. “It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swiveling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws,"" he said.

""Does this satellite photo of the harbor reveal a giant crab or unusual sand formation?"" Winter asks on his website.

Experts say neither.

""The idea of a giant 'crabzilla' would [be] very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax,"" Dr. Verity Nye, Ocean and Earth Science researcher at Southampton University, told the Daily Mail. ""I don't know what the currents are like around that harbor or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.""

Spider crabs, the largest known to British waters, grow to about 4 feet and inhabit much deeper waters than the those near the pier where Crabzilla is shown lurking.

Woman with three breasts: Real or hoax?,2183,discuss,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

Third boob likely a hoax,1286,discuss,"A massage therapist claims to have undergone plastic surgery to obtain a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) says she had the surgery “a few months ago” and is now hell bent on starring in her own reality TV show.

The 21-year-old has hired a camera crew to follow her around and hopes to pitch her show to MTV. Writing on her Facebook page, she says she has upcoming appearances on the Jimmy Kimmel show and the Inside Edition.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

Of the controversial surgery, she told Real Radio 104.1 she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the procedure.

“It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

Of the one who agreed to carry out the operation, she claimed: “He made me sign a non-disclosure agreement as he was scared he’d get in trouble.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

Tampa resident Tridevil, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, says her parents have not taken the news of her transformation well.

She said: “My mum ran out of the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad… he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil says the surgery cost $20,000 and that included a “nipple” implant. She claims to have had an areole tattooed around the nipple after the surgery.

Looks familiar: The three-breasted woman first made an appearance in 1999's Total Recall

She also revealed: “I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.

“Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know… feel pretty.”

Um, right.

Tridevil’s bold new look is of course reminiscent of that infamous scene from the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall.

Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film

Upon meeting a prostitute with three breasts, one enamoured suitor exclaims: “Baby, you make me wish I had three hands!”

The film was remade in 2012, and yes, the three-breasted woman made another appearance.

Toronto-based model and actress Kaitlyn Leeb took the role and even decided to display her (prosthetic) triple cleavage at a Comic Con event.

We think you’ll agree Leeb’s prosthetics are pretty convincing – could it be that Tridevil simply followed suit and hasn’t been under the knife after all?"

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

Justin Bieber Saved A Guy Getting Mauled By A Bear,2373,disagree,"Reports of more attacks in Yakutia bears on people 53-year-old Igor Nerungri Vorozhbitsyn ignored, they say, for his life more than once met nose to nose with clumsy and all circuits. So as usual without fear went fishing in the nearby Aldan region. From the road, a man went to the creek to winter quarters where usually stayed fishing. Weapons of a knife on his belt in his hands - rods, behind - the backpack.
To rain at times forced to throw a tight long cloak. A few kilometers left on the old highway. Pereobulsya, Bolotnikov tied to a backpack and walked toward the key Evota to zymes.
Coming in a somewhat macabre silence about three hundred meters, clearly felt that the rear - risk. At the same moment a powerful blow to the backpack knocked him down. Falling, he saw a couple of meters of a huge bear.
Igor himself considerable size, weight under one hundred pounds. But pounce beast with incredible force began to throw it as a toy. Poor fisherman tried to pull a knife, but the bitten hand predator is not obeyed, hanging whip.
What happened next, other than a miracle not to name. Bear attacks in the final chord in the chest and grabbed at the moment mobile fisherman made a sound.
- In the taiga time looked - it was 8:30 pm and put a mobile phone in his breast pocket - recalls that terrible battle Vorozhbitsyn. - I have an older model. Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri. Four hours of operation, and three surgeons literally collected on parched face bloodied pieces Igor. Then - three operations already in the Republican Hospital in Yakutsk. Fortunately, the fisherman left eye was saved. Igor saved and that the first shot hit on the head is not (bear paw easily cut out the skull), and a backpack. Played a protective role and dense coat. Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. But by a happy coincidence did not touch the internal organs and even ribs broken. And if not for mobile ...

Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman.
While doctors saved Igor Vorozhbitsyna hunters looking for a bear attacked him. Evoty literally combed the neighborhood with dogs. And on July 26 shot clumsy 2-3 years old. However, within a few kilometers hunters found more traces of bears. So what killed a man-eating beast or not, no one really can not tell."

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,448,agree,"Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wants to put an end to werewolf bar mitzvahs once and for all.

Kirchner adopted Argentinian teen Yair Tawil as her godson as part of a folktale that says the seventh-born son in a family will turn into a werewolf and eat unbaptized babies, the New York Daily News reports.

This may sound familiar to fans of 30 Rock:

Source: YouTube

Wait, what? According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobizon,"" the Independent explains. The werewolf-like beast ""shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.""

The legend seems ridiculous, but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentina's president in 1907, which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time-honored tradition, any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent, a gold medal and a full educational scholarship.


The boy's parents, Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, had written the president's office requesting the adoption in 1993, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a ""magical moment,"" calling the Tawils a ""marvelous family.""

But are they more marvelous than this?

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2500,agree,"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers' personal throat doctor denies ""performing an unauthorized procedure"" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN.

Dr. Gwen Korovin also ""categorically denies"" taking a selfie photo while Rivers was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the same source said Thursday.

The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN -- that staff members at the clinic told investigators Korovin snapped the selfie and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers.

Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic.

CNN's source close to the investigaton also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie.

Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers ""will think this is funny"" or ""would love this"" as she took the photo, the source said.

Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.

The source also provided more specific information about what procedures were done on Rivers.

Several clinic workers told investigators that it began with Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds.

Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning in the wake of Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore and hoarse throat, the source said.

Cohen detected something of concern, the source said..

Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cut off of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source.

Rivers was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.

Korovin was only authorized to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said.

Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated.

Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.

The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autograph photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews.

""I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music,"" Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year.

Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the reports:

""Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

""For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.""

The clinic is still open, although an accreditation group is calling for it to suspend procedures and surgeries, according to letters obtained by CNN. Patients were seen in the clinic's waiting room Wednesday.

The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF) sent representatives for an unscheduled visit to the clinic after hearing about Rivers' cardiac arrest, according to letters from the group.

The letters cited two ""deficiencies"" found by the representatives, declared the clinic to be in ""immediate jeopardy"" and placed it on ""emergency suspension."" The accreditation group said the clinic should stop procedures and surgeries ""until accreditation questions are settled.""

The clinic sent CNN a statement Wednesday night in response to questions about the accreditation association's letter putting the facility under ""emergency suspension.""

""Yorkville Endoscopy continues to maintain its federal, state and Quad A (AAAASF) authorization to be operational and provide patient care. Yorkville Endoscopy is committed to adhering to the standards established by Quad A (AAASF),"" the statement said.

While the accreditation agency has no power to shut a clinic down, the state of New York does. State health investigators also found deficiencies in Rivers' treatment, according to a source close to the death investigation. These include the participation of River's personal throat doctor.

Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures. ... Nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.

Woman Gets Third Boob to Appear Unattractive to Men,2486,disagree,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

Report: Second American Journalist Beheaded by Islamic State Terrorists,2339,discuss,"(CNN) -- The ISIS terror group has published a video titled ""A second message to America,"" showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The video also threatens the life of British captive, David Haines.

Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed, saying he is ""paying the price"" for U.S. intervention.

The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to U.S. President Barack Obama, telling him, ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.""

Last week, Sotloff's mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.

""Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,"" she said. ""He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.""

Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist, James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloff's fate depended on what President Barack Obama did next in Iraq.

Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public.

Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff's release for the past year.

Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami.""

In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area.

He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey -- among other countries -- and eventually Syria."

People have been flocking to a website to judge for themselves whether this picture shows a huge crustacean in shallow water at a harbour mouth in Kent or is just an elaborate hoax.

Quinton Winter, who collates strange and spooky sightings for his Weird Whitstable website, at first thought the image sent to him by a follower showed an unusual sand formation in the shape of a crab but is now convinced it’s a true monster of the deep.

**CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE CREATURES IN DIGUISE**

He believes he saw the giant lurking close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer in the harbour at Whitstable, which is famed for its oysters.

He said: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

The picture appears to show an edible crab, scientific name cancer pagurus, a species commonly found in British water but which normally only grows to 10 inches, weighing six pounds.

According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."

Commented on escape status «Abu Obeida», saying: «Perhaps it is not the first time that escapes the leading figures of the organization, where he escaped from lawful period for the organization in the city, as well as one of the judges of the organization of Saudi citizenship»."
ISIS Allegedly Beheads Second Captive American Journalist,1250,discuss,"BEIRUT (AP) - An Internet video purports to show the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State group.

Sotloff, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, had last been seen in Syrian in August 2013 until he appeared in a video released online last month by the Islamic State group that showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley.

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against the backdrop of an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq.

In the video distributed Tuesday and entitled ""A Second Message to America,"" Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter.

A Florida native, Sotloff grew up in Miami. He graduated from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, N.H., where he received a journalism award, according to Manchester TV station WMUR. He went on to attend the University of Central Florida.

Sotloff's mother recently made a video appeal, pleading for the release of her son."
Three Boobs Are Most Likely Two Boobs and a Lie,1244,agree,"The Tampa, Fla. woman who claimed to have had plastic surgery to add a third breast is fake, according to TMZ.

The woman, who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil, was reportedly discovered to have faked the plastic surgery after TMZ obtained a police report filed by Tridevil after her bag was stolen at Tampa International Airport.

TMZ reports that the bag was stolen off of an American Airlines conveyor belt and a ""3 breast prosthesis"" was found inside by police after they recovered the bag.

Buzzfeed initially reported the woman's strange look landed her appearances on ""Inside Edition"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" but FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

FOX411 talked to ""Inside Edition,"" and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she's not on the schedule that gets sent out with ""Kimmel'"" guests either.

In trying to further track down the story, we did find Tridevil's real name and cell phone number, and we gave her a call, but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message.

Which is a shame, because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale.

Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery “a few months ago” and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request.

“They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it,” she said. “I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it.”

She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she wouldn’t reveal his identity. She said paid $20,000 for the purported surgery.

Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV."

"Sorry, Argentina's President Didn't Actually Adopt a Jewish Werewolf",861,disagree,"The president of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish grandson in order to prevent him becoming a werewolf.

— Cristina Kirchner (@CFKArgentina) December 23, 2014

Hmmm, let us explain.

According to an old Argentinian legend, the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between is liable to turn into one of the mythical creatures.

Fear was so rife in the country that families would often give up their seventh-born sons for adoption or even kill them.

In the 1920s a law was passed to counteract the legend. It offered presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday but only for Catholic families.

In 2009 a decree was passed to extend the law to other religions.

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written to the then- president in 1993 but were turned down. After the updated law was passed they tried again and Kirchner agreed.

She said: ""It was magical to receive Iair Tawil, the first presidential godson in national history to profess the Jewish faith. Iair, 21, is completely sweet.

‘Crabzilla’ a 50-foot colossal conundrum,2282,discuss,"IS it Crabzilla or Claws? This aerial image of a giant crab lurking at a British resort has become an internet sensation.

People have been flocking to a website to judge for themselves whether this picture shows a huge crustacean in shallow water at a harbour mouth in Kent or is just an elaborate hoax.

Quinton Winter, who collates strange and spooky sightings for his Weird Whitstable website, at first thought the image sent to him by a follower showed an unusual sand formation in the shape of a crab but is now convinced it’s a true monster of the deep.

**CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE CREATURES IN DIGUISE**

He believes he saw the giant lurking close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer in the harbour at Whitstable, which is famed for its oysters.

He said: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

The picture appears to show an edible crab, scientific name cancer pagurus, a species commonly found in British water but which normally only grows to 10 inches, weighing six pounds.

The biggest known crab species is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
UK looking into reports IS beheading suspect wounded,1126,discuss,"One of the world's most wanted men ""Jihadi John"" has reportedly been wounded in an airstrike.

Jihadi John”, the man accused of executing British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning and two Americans held by Isil, may have been injured in an airstrike on an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border a week ago.

The Foreign Office said it had received reports the terrorist had been wounded but could not confirm them.

A spokesman said it did not have the resources in Syria to enable it to verify the rumours but confirmed the office had received reports.

The Mail On Sunday reported that the British-accented militant had been wounded while attending a meeting of slamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) leaders and was rushed to hospital following the US-led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim, western Iraq, last Saturday that killed around 10 Isil commanders and wounded 40 more.

The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, sparking initial rumours that he had been killed.

""Jihadi John"", named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background, is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers Mr Haines and Mr Henning.

The masked executioner, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, has become a leading figure in the Islamist group.

The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list, referring to him as ""the one who slaughtered the journalists"".

The wounded men were then driven to the Isil's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, according to the Mail's source.

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 home-grown militants fighting for Isil in Syria and Iraq, and Prime Minister David Cameron this week announced plans to stop them returning to Britain for two years.

He said jihadis who have travelled to fight with extremists will not be able to return to Britain for two years.

The Home Secretary will issue a Temporary Exclusion Orders, cancelling their passports and placing them on a ‘no fly list’ which will prevent them returning to the UK."
Triple-breasted woman pictured before 'operation' and vows surgery footage will prove third boob is no hoax,2335,discuss,"Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

Third boob likely a hoax,1618,agree,"Did a woman claiming to have a third breast play a hoax on us?

Snopes.com came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay $20,000 (£12,190) for an extra breast.

It argued the fact she didn’t have anyone else take the photos was suspicious, and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevil.com was called Alisha Hessler, who was no stranger to the internet.

A business page attributed Hessler, states she is the ‘provider of internet hoaxes since 2014’, which could possibly be the most damning evidence of all.

It also emerged Hessler, who has not been confirmed as being Tridevil, was arrested for fraudulent use of personal information in 2013.

In the same year she claimed she forced a man who assaulted her to hold an embarrassing sign on a motorway saying ‘I beat women. Honk if I’m a scumbag.’

She had reportedly threatened to tell police of his crime if he didn’t.

Officers confirmed she had withdrawn a complaint against him when pressed for more details, according to Snopes.

A top plastic surgeon, Mr Nilesh Sojitra, also cast doubt over the surgery after claiming no ‘reasonable’ doctor would perform the operation

‘Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would,’ he told Buzzfeed.

From CBS Tampa Bay:

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

Raven-Symoné Slams Rumors That Bill Cosby Molested Her,2262,agree,"Raven-Symoné took to Instagram to deny rumors that Bill Cosby molested her while she was on The Cosby Show.

The rumor has been gaining steam for a few days now ever since a site called Hip Hop Hangover published a story claiming the actress was drugged and raped by Cosby and had filed charges against him. That site is (according to their own disclaimer) a ""gossip parody and satirical publication and for entertainment purposes only."" I have no idea who in the hell would consider a story about a young girl being drugged and raped ""entertainment"" but there you have the world of the Internet, folks. Snopes debunked this rumor awhile ago, but just in case people still need more proof, Raven-Symoné posted her own response to this on her Instagram page today:

I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!
I'm sorry that she even has to do this. Sites like this are not ""parody"" or ""satire"" sites, OK? They exist strictly to farm clicks by posting fake stories and deliberately manipulate people. (They should never been lumped in the same category as places like The Onion.) They know damn well that they what they're doing, and slapping a ""satire"" label on it shouldn't excuse their vulgarity and cheap ploy for attention.

Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,765,agree,"As traditions go this may be the most unbelievable tale you may ever read - the President of Argentina has adopted a Jewish boy as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf.

Christina Fernandez de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family last week at her office to mark the 100-year-old Argentine custom.

According to legend the seventh son born to a family turns into a ferocious ""el lobison"" or werewolf – on the first Friday after his 13th birthday.

The country began to introduce adoption procedures to quell the fear of the people in the 19th century who believed their sons could turn into werewolfs (the fear was so extreme in some cases people murdered their baby boys).

It has become customary since 1907 but formally established in 1973 for the president to adopt their seventh sons and daughters who also receive a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Tawil's parents wrote to the president in 1993 for their son to be the first Jewish boy to be adopted and they got their wish this year, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

Until 2009, the tradition only applied to Catholic children.

Last week's unusual ceremony between the president and Tawil, witnessed by his parents and three brothers, happened at the same time as Hanukkah - the eight-day Jewish festival that commemorates the rededication of the holy Temple in Jerusalem in 165 BC.

Fernandez de Kirchner tweeted: ""I didn't know it but his visit coincided with the Hanukkah celebration. The father said it wasn't a coincidence.""

She added the meeting with him and his family was a ""magical moment""."
Apple could be eyeing purchase of social networking app Path,946,discuss,"Last night, Pando’s Michael Carney cited a well-placed source who claims that Apple is on the verge of buying flailing social network, Path. Today, on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, Path founder Dave Morin was asked about the report.

Morin’s response was straight from the Dummies Guide To Media Training: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation.” When TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino pointed out “that’s not a no,” Morin repeated his response.

There are a couple of things to note here. For one thing, from a PR point of view, Morin’s response was exactly right. If the deal is about to happen, then he’s hardly going to confirm it on stage to a reporter ahead of time. If the deal isn’t about to happen, Morin can still benefit from the idea that Path is still valuable to someone.

And yet, it’s interesting how Morin’s “no comment” flies in the face of a promise he made to Pando’s Sarah Lacy last year about how he and Path would deal with the press in future. As Sarah explained at the time:

I explained the problem from the journalists’ side, and asked Morin what he proposed for a publication and entrepreneurs who want to start having a fairer dialog. Not a favorable one, but a fair one. Something that helps readers more than the denial, the reporter speculation, and the rewritten press release. He said for his part he was no longer going to obfuscate anything. If a reporter gets a scoop, and it’s accurate and he or she calls him up, he’ll say congratulations and tell them to run with it. No more playing games.

Given Morin’s response on stage today, and the fact Carney contacted him last night for comment but received no response, perhaps a more accurate promise would have been “No more playing games, unless I’m scared shitless of upsetting Apple.”"
Kid Suspended For Allegedly Threatening Classmate With ‘Hobbit’ Magic,1684,discuss,"A Grade 4 student was reportedly suspended from his Texas school after he threatened to make another boy disappear with his Lord of the Rings replica ring.

Jason Steward told the Odessa American that his son had seen The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies last weekend and got himself a replica of fabled One Ring.

Steward said his son wore it to Kermit Elementary School, where he told another boy the ring's magic could make him disappear.

Steward said the principal told him no threats would be tolerated — even magical ones.

The school wouldn't comment on the suspension, citing privacy concerns.

The boy has been in trouble before, his father said — once for referring to another child's skin colour, and once for bringing a children's book to school that had a chapter about pregnancy.

But the dad assured the New York Daily News the nine-year-old Tolkien enthusiast is not dangerous.

""I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend's existence,"" he said."

Doc calls macabre 'selfie' claims completely crazy,2089,discuss,"Was Joan Rivers’ death preventable? New information suggests that Rivers should not have gone into cardiac arrest on that fateful August day. According to Radar Online, Joan’s daughter Melissa is ready to take legal action against the clinic that performed a “routine endoscopy” that went terribly wrong.

“It’s become very clear to Melissa and experts she has spoken to that her mother didn’t have to die. This was a routine endoscopy that went wrong. Melissa has also been told that staff members at Yorkville Endcoscopy revealed a shocking detail to medical investigators looking into Joan’s death — something occurred during the procedure that wasn’t medically related.”

Joan Rivers’ death was unexpected, and learning that she didn’t have to die is perhaps the hardest part. Many people suspect that something out of the ordinary happened when Joan was put under for her procedure, especially since her doctor (Dr. Cohen) parted ways with Yorkville Endoscopy right after the incident with Rivers occurred. Sources say that Melissa Rivers wants to wait until she learns her mother’s cause of death before she takes legal action.

“It was something related to Joan’s personal ear, nose and throat doctor and it wasn’t about the unplanned biopsy she did. Melissa will await the outcome of the official medical investigation and then absolutely file the lawsuits.”

According to CNN, staffers at the clinic revealed that Dr. Cohen took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia. Also, Dr. Cohen reportedly took a biopsy of something that he found during the endoscopy without Rivers’ consent. It very well may have been the biopsy that caused Rivers to stop breathing.

“Investigators believe that Rivers’ vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.”

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Joan was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after a staff member called 911. Despite resuscitation efforts, Rivers was placed on life support when she was admitted to the hospital. There had been so many rumors about Joan “getting better” and “pulling through,” but once Melissa confirmed that her mom was on life support, the public sort of figured that things weren’t improving.

Rivers passed away on Sept. 4 (exactly one week after being admitted to the hospital) after being taken off life support.

Five reasons 'Crabzilla' is definitely not real,2100,agree,"The man behind the world famous 50ft Crabzilla spotted lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable has described the furore caused by the colossal crustacean as “a bit of fun”.

Quinton Winter, of Station Road, told KentOnline he was stunned by the amount of coverage the sea monster has clawed after it appeared at his exhibition at the Horsebridge Centre.

Aerial images of the shadowy figure emerged on the artist’s bizarre blog Weird Whitstable – which documents supernatural sightings across the town.

Artist Quinton Winter
This week it was splashed on the Daily Star front page with the story also featuring in worldwide news outlets including Australia, Malaysia and France.

But despite its popularity with the global media, the tale left online readers feeling rather crabby with criticisms it was “juvenile”.

Quinton said: “When I saw the picture I thought I could use it in my exhibition.

“I thought it may have been a sand formation but it looked like a crab to me.

“I’m not trying to lie about anything, it’s just a bit of fun.”

KM Group graphic artist Ashley Austen took a sceptical view of the paranormal find.

Crabzilla was 'spotted' off the coast of WhitstableCrabzilla was spotted lurking beneath the water
He said: “The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the artist had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters.”

But Mr Winter said he didn’t think the image would be taken too seriously.

He said: “Sometimes you put stuff out there and no one takes any notice and then sometimes unexpectedly it goes everywhere. It has been a strange reaction.

“I don’t think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?” - Quinton Winter
“I don’t think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?”

According to Weird Whitstable, Crabzilla surfaced in July last year at a popular crabbing spot after it was spotted by two young boys.

The boys, which included Mr Winter’s son, were blissfully unaware as the crab slipped silently under the water sideways.

According to the Marine Biological Association, the largest species is the Japanese spider crab which can grow up to 3.7m across - the size of a small car.

Other strange sightings reported by Weird Whitstable include a haunted fence in Tankerton."
Woman with three breasts ‘was a fake who has tricked people online before’,1903,discuss,"Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist in Tampa, Florida, claims that she had a third breast implanted to get famous, land a reality show, and become ""unattractive to men"" because she doesn't ""want to date anymore."" From CBS Tampa Bay:

...“It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they’re breaking the code of ethics,” she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non-disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery.

Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola, Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo.

Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money.

“My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really isn’t happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,” she said. “My dad is still there for me.”

Transgender Teen Commits Suicide & Pens A Heartbreaking Note Urging The World To Change,1717,discuss,"A 17-year-old transgender teenage girl in Ohio has died by what appears to have been suicide, leaving behind a Tumblr note that blames her parents for not accepting her gender identity, isolating her, and forcing her to attend faith-based therapy. ""There's no winning,"" the note reads, in part. ""There's no way out.""

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan Alcorn, was walking along Interstate 71 when she was hit and killed by a semi-truck around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of Sunday, December 28. The local news accounts refer to Alcorn as male, but she blogged frequently on a Tumblr called ""Lazer Princess"" about living as a trans teen. Judging by the Tumblr, she was a fan of Sailor Moon, feminism, and stockings with cats on them; she regularly re-blogged inspirational photos of trans adults.

It's also where she published a post titled ""Suicide Note,"" which she had pre-scheduled before her death. From the beginning of the note:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don't be sad, it's for the better. The life I would've lived isn't worth living in… because I'm transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, and I've felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally ""boyish"" things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.
Alcorn apparently believed she'd never be able to transition successfully. She concludes:

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say ""it gets better"" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ""that's fucked up"" and fix it. Fix society. Please.
On Facebook, Alcorn's mother has written, ""My sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck."" The message has been shared repeatedly by people who are upset that she is misgendering her child.

This is gut-wrenching, and it was avoidable. On Twitter, trans activists are mourning Leelah:

'Crabzilla' or 'Crapzilla' -- You Decide,2245,discuss,"A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent, UK, is proving a great drawcard… for the website that’s claiming it’s a giant crab.

Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UK’s weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it.

But even he couldn’t believe this aerial photograph of a 50-foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour:

So he went to check it out for himself.

“At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’,” Winter said.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

Saudi Arabia May Be Taking Misogyny to the Skies,1151,discuss,"The calendar may have just flipped to 2015, but Saudi Arabia is partying like it's 1755.

The Daily Mail reports that Saudia, the kingdom's national airline, will introduce gender-segregated flights. Except close relatives, men and women flying on Saudia can reportedly look forward to assigned seating based on their naughty bits.

The discriminatory practice stems from multiple complaints lodged by male fliers who were unhappy that other men were allowed to sit next to their wives and female family members. Some men also objected to the conduct of a female flight attendant, which they deemed too ""flirty.""

The change was first reported by Gulf media outlets, according to the Daily Mail. ""There are solutions to this problem,"" Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd told Ajel, a Saudi Arabian newspaper. ""We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers.""

The airline will apparently include orders for flight-booking staff on the ground to make sure men and women are separated, Emirates247 reports. According to Mashable, however, a marketing manager for the airline is denying their plans to segregate passengers.

Saudia already follows a variety of religious practices onboard, including the prohibition of alcohol and pork dishes and reading a Quran verse before takeoff. The airline also chooses not to hire Saudi women to work as cabin crew.

Similar complaints have been heard on flights traveling to Israel. In September, a flight headed to Tel Aviv from New York was delayed because several ultra-Orthodox Jewish men wouldn't sit next to women who weren't family members; more recently, a Delta flight was delayed for half an hour because ultra-Orthodox men refused to be seated next to women, and other passengers wouldn't change seats with them.

One Chicago woman started a petition on Change.org to stop the practice of forcing women to change seats, arguing that ""one person's religious rights do not trump another person's civil rights.""

She's right, and the same could be said of discriminatory rules like those that Saudia reportedly plans to introduce. But given its already troubled history of the treatment of women — it was ranked the third-worst country in the Arab world for women — these new guidelines unfortunately appear to be more of the same.

Mic has reached out to Saudia for comment but received a message indicating that the company's inbox was full. We'll update if we hear back."

Third boob likely a hoax,1907,disagree,"In order to become a reality star, a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest.

Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil (not her real name) decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV, the 9 News reported.

Tridevil reportedly spent $20,000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen, the website reported.

However, Tridevil's doctors could not create an artificial areola, which she managed on her own by tattooing it.

Nevertheless, the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics.

""I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they're breaking the code of ethics,"" she told real radio 104.1, via 9News.

When asked about her family's reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant, she said: ""My mum ran out of the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.""

Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore.

""I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore,"" she said.

""Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make-up and cute clothes, I can still, you know, feel pretty.""

Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular.

""Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary, bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self-worth and critical thinking,"" a report from NDLA reads.

Three-breasted woman outed as fake by Tampa police,2359,discuss,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

Areas in the neighborhood of al Jbeleh in the city of Deir Ezzor were bombarded by the regime forces with no information about casualties so far."
Climate Change is a Hoax,2579,agree,"One of the main lines of evidence used by the Obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesn’t exist in the real world, according to a new report by climate researchers.

Researchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites, weather balloons, weather stations and buoys and found the so-called “tropical hotspot” relied upon by the EPA to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant “simply does not exist in the real world.”

They found that once El Ninos are taken into account, “there is no ‘record setting’ warming to be concerned about.”

“These analysis results would appear to leave very, very little doubt but that EPA’s claim of a Tropical Hot Spot (THS), caused by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, simply does not exist in the real world,” reads the report by economist James Wallace, climatologist John Christy and meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo.

“Also critically important, even on an all-other-things-equal basis, this analysis failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 13 critically important temperature time series analyzed,” they wrote.

When EPA released its CO2 endangerment finding in 2009, it used three lines of evidence to bolster its argument that greenhouse gases threatened human health through global warming.
The crux of EPA’s argument rested on the existence of a “tropical hotspot” where global warming would be most apparent. That is, there should be enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere — the “fingerprint” of global warming.

EPA’s endangerment finding is the legal basis for agency global warming regulations, including the Clean Power Plan (CPP) now being fought over in federal court. CPP aims to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent by 2030 and could cost $41 billion a year, according to independent estimates.

D’Aleo and his colleagues looked at the data and controlled for El Ninos and La Ninas. What they found was that once natural oceanic warming and cooling events are accounted for, there’s no warming trend.

“El Nino is not by any means new,” D’Aleo told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “The El Ninos and La Ninas do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster as we showed in our paper.”

Tropospheric temperatures are mainly measured by satellites and weather balloons, which collect data from the lowest few miles of the atmosphere. Satellites already show only slight warming since 1979, but they are sensitive to El Ninos and La Ninas.

Removing El Ninos and La Ninas from tropospheric temperatures creates “temperature time series each having a flat trend.” Basically, D’Aleo and his colleagues found oceanic warming events are responsible for virtually all the warming since 1977 when El Ninos became more frequent and stronger.

On the flip side, the recent “hiatus” in global warming can be explained by more frequent La Ninas, according to D’Aleo.

“It is an accepted fact that El Ninos bring global warmth and La Ninas cooling,” D’Aleo said. “It is thus not at all surprising that the period from 1947 to 1977 brought cooling, 1977 to 1997 warming and we had a flat trend from 1997 to current.”

With El Ninos and La Ninas adjusted out of the data, only volcanoes are left — base on EPA assumptions — to impact the climate, and D’Aleo’s report acknowledges “it was still possible that the volcanic activity was hiding CO2’s impact.”

Volcanic aerosols can have a cooling effect on global average temperature; the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo caused a dip in satellite temperature data that lasted for a couple years.

“The temperature data measurements that were analyzed were taken by many different entities using balloons, satellites, buoys and various land based techniques,” reads the report. “Needless to say, if regardless of data source, the results are the same, the analysis findings should be considered highly credible.”

Climate scientists have been debating for years over the existence of the “tropical hotspot.”

Christy, who co-runs the premier satellite temperature dataset at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with climatologist Roy Spencer, has presented evidence that climate models overpredicted warming in the tropical troposphere.

Ross McKitrick, an environmental economist at the University of Guelph in Canada, also ran the numbers and found climate models overestimated warming in the tropical troposphere.

McKitrick provided evidence of a phase shift in 1977 from dominant El Ninas to El Ninos — just like D’Aleo, Christy and Williams found.

“Over the 55-years from 1958 to 2012, climate models not only significantly over-predict observed warming in the tropical troposphere, but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than is observed,” McKitrick wrote in a 2014 study."
Heart specialist questions benefits of high-intensity Tabata workout regime,2549,agree,"It is hailed as the best way to get fit, with celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Katie Holmes purporting to be fans.

High intensity training - or HIIT as it is known -  is a form of strength training that involves the repetition of short bursts of activity or weight training.

But, if a person isn’t accustomed to this form of exercise, the workouts could be doing more harm than good, experts have warned.

They revealed exhausting high intensity training can increase a person’s risk of heart disease and cancer.

These work-outs also weaken the body’s ability to fight off free radicals – which are the harmful chemicals that alter DNA and can lead to a host of illnesses.

Study author Dr Robert Boushel, of the University of British Columbia, in Canada, said: ‘If you’re new to going to the gym, participating in high-intensity “sprint” classes may increase your performance but might not be healthy for you.’

High intensity workouts are said to be able to burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour."
Heart specialist questions benefits of high-intensity Tabata workout regime,2550,discuss,"Vanilla exercise is passé. Fitness fan-atics are putting some Shades of Grey into their workouts, opting for short, sharp, punishing regimes that promise to get you twice as fit in half the time of a regular gym session. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) sessions can last for just 20 minutes. Spend 30 seconds pushing your body and metabolism out of its comfort zone by working out as hard as you can — say, by sprinting — then recover with lighter exercise, such as jogging, for 20 seconds before powering up again. And again and again.

Studies have shown that within months, even weeks, the body’s systems can adapt positively to the increases in stress and as a result fitness improves enormously. Research suggests that these regimes can help to reduce blood sugar levels and offset Type 2 diabetes, as well as improving strength, endurance and muscle tone. So no more excuses for those previously claiming to be ‘too busy’ to work out.

And yet, despite the evidence, controversy is now clouding this intense exercise phenomenon. With the BBC presenter Andrew Marr’s revelation that he believes his recent stroke was linked to intense interval training on a rowing machine, there is a fear that HIIT can cause more harm than good, because what all variations of these workouts share (some focus on strength, others on cardio) is that they are punishing to the extreme. So you have to be reasonably fit to begin with in order to try them safely. This, say experts, is where some people are going wrong. ‘These types of sessions are not suitable for everyone,’ says Greg Whyte, professor of applied sport and exercise science at Liverpool John Moores University. ‘You need to have a good fitness background before you even take part. Pushing yourself to those limits is strongly inadvisable if you are in any way unfit or have underlying problems.’

People mistakenly think that because they last for just a few minutes, these workouts are an easy option. Don’t be fooled. Steve Barrett, a personal trainer who has worked with leading athletes, says, ‘They should leave you feeling as if you literally couldn’t do anything more.’ And that degree of effort, says Dr Dominic Micklewright, director of the sport, performance and fatigue research unit at the University of Essex, can mean ‘there is almost certainly an increased risk of injury among untrained people with this sort of approach’. Couple intense workouts with minimal calorie intake or fasting and you could find yourself suffering more for your fitness than you imagined; with blood sugar levels too low to sustain you through these workouts, headaches, muscle weakness and nausea or feeling faint could result.

None of this means that, as long as you are fit enough, the high-intensity approach should be avoided. Barrett uses it with some of his fitter clients and says it should be employed two to four times a week, in addition to run-of-the-mill activities such as steady running, cycling or swimming. And most experts agree that, if you build up to it, interval training of some sort is essential for fitness progression, but that a watered-down version of HIIT is more appropriate for the masses. Exercise scientists at McMaster University in Canada recently tried a ‘gentler’ version of a HIIT schedule, involving a minute of effort followed by a minute of easy recovery repeated ten times over 20 minutes, on a group including some previously unfit volunteers. All displayed remarkable improvements in overall health and fitness after several weeks. ‘With any exercise, the key thing is to feel like you’ve worked hard, but not to the point that you are in extreme physical discomfort or pain,’ says Barrett. ‘You do need to push yourself harder in order to progress, but it should be effort that is just within the realms of your ability. Always listen to your body.’"
Heart specialist questions benefits of high-intensity Tabata workout regime,2551,disagree,"Many people with chronic health problems resign themselves to lives of modest activity or no activity at all, thinking vigorous exercise is unsafe or that they lack the stamina for it. But recent studies are proving just the opposite.

They are showing that high-intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activities for many patients with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, pulmonary disease, arthritis and Parkinson’s disease.

The studies strongly suggest that a more demanding but more efficient and often more enjoyable form of exercise known as high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is not only safe for most patients but more effective at preventing or reversing the deficits associated with many chronic ailments.

Although once reserved for athletes seeking a competitive advantage and for healthy people wanting to burn more body fat, HIIT is now being studied as a treatment that is sometimes as effective as medication for many people with chronic health problems.

Researchers have found that repeatedly pushing the body close to its exercise limits for very brief periods, interspersed with periods of rest, is more effective than continuous moderate activity at improving cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and mechanical functions.

Instead of continuous movement for 20 or more minutes, as is typical for exercise walkers, joggers and cyclists, HIIT usually involves 30 to 60 seconds of exercise near the peak of a person’s ability, followed by a comparable recovery period of easy activity, with the sequence repeated for a total of about 20 minutes three times a week.

“We know that exercise is good for people at risk of chronic disease, but people tend not to exercise,” said Jonathan P. Little, a specialist in exercise physiology at the University of British Columbia at Okanagan. Yet he and other researchers report that study participants find interval training more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise, making it more likely that people will continue it on their own.

Various activities can be adapted to interval training, including cycling, swimming, walking and jogging, especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill. But HIIT is possible indoors and out, for example by alternating sprints with more moderate exercise.

The intensity is tailored to an individual’s starting ability. “The high-intensity component is set at 80 to 90 percent of the person’s maximum aerobic capacity,” Dr. Little said. Researchers commonly use exercise bikes and treadmills to adjust the pace mechanically.

However, high-intensity exercise, even just half a minute at a time, is not appropriate for everyone. In a recent report in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal, Dr. Little; his wife, Mary E. Jung, also at the University of British Columbia; and Marcus W. Kilpatrick of the University of South Florida wrote that HIIT “is only appropriate for low-risk individuals, moderate-risk individuals who have been cleared for vigorous intensities by a medical professional, and high-risk individuals who are under direct medical supervision during exercise training.”

Among the physiological benefits of HIIT are the body’s increased ability to use oxygen and insulin, as well as arteries that are more elastic than continuous moderate exercise can achieve.

“We’ve seen, for example, that interval training is remarkably effective at lowering glucose levels in people with diabetes,” Dr. Little said in an interview. “Just one session improves a person’s glucose level.”

A 12-week controlled study in Denmark of high-intensity interval walking for patients with Type 2 diabetes showed it helped control blood glucose levels better than continuous moderate exercise, even though the same number of calories was expended by both groups. Interval training also was more effective at enhancing the patients’ physical fitness and reducing body fat relative to lean muscle tissue.

By making blood vessels better able to expand, HIIT can improve the cardiovascular system’s ability to respond to added exertion. Oxygen-carrying blood can flow more smoothly through arteries that are wide open, which also reduces the risk of a vessel-blocking clot.

The body’s ability to use oxygen efficiently improves markedly “after as little as two weeks of training” with HIIT, the researchers wrote. Peak oxygen uptake — the amount of oxygen an individual can use during intense exercise — is considered the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and an independent predictor of illness and death in cardiac patients.

“Too many people think incorrectly that high-intensity exercise is only for athletes, that it’s a heart attack waiting to happen,” Dr. Little said. On the contrary, the research strongly suggests, it is more likely to reduce the risk of a heart attack.

In a 2012 report reviewing the effects of HIIT in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure, researchers in Canada, France and Switzerland wrote that “HIIT appears safe and better tolerated by patients than moderate-intensity continuous exercise” and more effective at increasing patients’ peak oxygen uptake, blood vessel flexibility and pumping ability of the heart.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are often unable to exercise long enough to gain needed health benefits. But they can do HIIT for long periods with less shortness of breath and leg discomfort, researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens have reported.

Stroke patients with persistent disabilities can also benefit from HIIT. As rehabilitation specialists at the University of Cincinnati wrote this month in BioPortfolio, stroke patients with residual weakness “enter a vicious cycle of limited activity and deconditioning.” But while regular aerobic exercise can improve their function and cardiovascular health, preliminary studies, including one in Trondheim, Norway, suggest that patients do even better with HIIT. The Norwegian team reported that the improvements persisted for months after the six-week high-intensity exercise program ended.

And Polish researchers demonstrated that HIIT could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that makes it difficult for Parkinson’s disease patients to move their arms and legs. The researchers, from the University School of Physical Education in Krakow, Poland, showed in 11 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s symptoms that eight weeks of HIIT, three times a week, on a stationary bike had a global benefit, improving both lower and upper body function.

Reductions in rigidity and stiffness correlated with an increase in a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which the researchers suggested could have stimulated the growth and function of nerves normally influenced by dopamine, the neurotransmitter that declines in Parkinson’s disease.

Why Your Workout Should Be High-Intensity,2548,disagree,"A workout so intense that it worries some professionals is set to become the fitness trend of 2014. High intensity training (HIT) used to be the preserve of the most dedicated fitness fanatics but is heading into the mainstream, with one of the UK's largest gym companies capitalising on its popularity.

Fitness First is launching Tabata classes containing a four-minute form of HIT in 50 of its London gyms this month before rolling out the classes nationwide to its 180,000 members in the new year.

The chain claims the Tabata method has been ""scientifically proven to be the most effective way to increase both aerobic and anaerobic fitness"". Its website cites tests using the system which it says increased VO2 max – the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise – by 13% in six weeks. It says a trial using 30-second ""bursts of intensity"" with two-minute rest periods was not as effective.

Japanese scientist Professor Izumi Tabata gave his name to the method while working with his country's Olympic speed-skating team. His routine consisted of a combination of 20 seconds of intense exercise, followed by 10 seconds of rest to a rotation lasting four minutes.

Fitness First's website states: ""Professor Tabata's latest research shows that if [his regime] is followed correctly, the body will continue to consume more calories for up to 12 hours after the exercise class. These are additional calories to those consumed by the body at rest – so over and above the so-called RMB or Resting Metabolic Rate.""

The dangers of HIT training, especially for people who are middle-aged, was highlighted this year when Andrew Marr said that the stroke which almost killed him occurred in the middle of an intense workout on his rowing machine at home.

Fitness First's online promotion does include an advisory note for anyone considering the Tabata class to consult a doctor before beginning the routines, especially if they have existing medical conditions. A spokesman said the 10-minute warm-up followed by a four-minute Tabata rotation ""will reap the same benefits as an hour on an exercise bike cycling at moderate rate"".

Cardiologist and fitness enthusiast Dr Aseem Malhotra questioned if HIT is the best form of exercise. ""Although I don't object in principle to high intensity training, there is no long-term data into its benefits. People exercise for all different reasons,"" he said. ""Some like to push their body to the limits, others do it competitively, but for the majority it's for improving overall health. No one can doubt the multitude of benefits of regular exercise, and as a regular gym enthusiast myself I know of the benefits as much as anyone. But, like anything, too much exercise can be a bad thing, with good data revealing that the greatest cardiovascular benefit for running was up to 20 miles a week at a moderate pace. If you ran more than this at a faster pace the benefits started to get lost.""

A study of up to 10,000 former Olympic athletes published in the British Medical Journal revealed that in disciplines with high-intensity activity, such as cycling, boxing and rowing, competitors did not live longer than those at low-intensity sports such as cricket and golf. ""In fact, those athletes who engaged in high intensity physical contact sports had a higher mortality than those in the lowest intensity,"" said Malhotra. ""For the majority of the population, improving longevity and general health can be done by brisk walking for 20 minutes three times a week – and doesn't involve spending money joining a gym.""

HIT's surge in popularity was highlighted by a recent survey of almost 30,000 people for the American College of Sports Medicine, which showed that, although once the workout of choice for twenty and thirtysomethings, older people and non-fitness enthusiasts planned to attempt the regime in 2014. Last year HIT did not appear in the top 20 of the ACSM's annual list predicting fitness trends, but this year it is number one.Professor Walt Thompson from the University of Georgia and lead author of the ACSM report said: ""We've never seen something introduced to the market and catch on so fast."""

10 studies proving GMOs are harmful? Not if science matters,2568,disagree,"As genetically modified (GM) foods are starting to intrude in our diet concerns have been expressed regarding GM food safety. These concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented. Animal toxicity studies with certain GM foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems. The review of these studies should not be conducted separately for each GM food, but according to the effects exerted on certain organs it may help us create a better picture of the possible health effects on human beings. The results of most studies with GM foods indicate that they may cause some common toxic effects such as hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or reproductive effects and may alter the hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters. However, many years of research with animals and clinical trials are required for this assessment. The use of recombinant GH or its expression in animals should be re-examined since it has been shown that it increases IGF-1 which may promote cancer."
10 studies proving GMOs are harmful? Not if science matters,2569,discuss,"You don't have to look hard to find genetically modified food on supermarket shelves: More than 85 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States comes from seeds whose DNA has been rejiggered (to increase yields), and those two crops play starring roles in countless processed foods, from soda to salad dressing to bread. Advocates say genetically modified (GM) foods allow farmers to produce more with fewer chemicals—which means a cleaner environment and cheaper groceries for us all. But the question remains: What impact do GM foods have on our health?

The answer is, no one really knows. GM foods have been on the market only since 1994, and research on their long-term effects on humans is scarce. To date most of the studies have been done on animals; worryingly, though, some of those studies link GM foods to altered metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver malfunction, and reduced fertility. In one experiment, multiple generations of hamsters were fed a diet of GM soy; by the third generation, they were losing the ability to produce offspring, producing about half as many pups as the non-GM soy group.

In addition, allergy sufferers worry that, as genes are transferred between plants, allergenic proteins (from, say, peanuts or wheat) will pop up in unexpected places (like soy or sugar). Richard Goodman, PhD, a professor of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a former scientist for Monsanto, says that seed companies run sophisticated tests to prevent that kind of mistake from happening. But inserting new genes into a seed's delicately constructed genome is always a gamble because scientists can't predict all the consequences. There is, for example, the possibility of creating brand-new allergens.

Despite the potential health implications, more GM foods appear each year. In 2011 the USDA approved the planting of genetically enhanced sugar beets (sucrose) and alfalfa (hay for livestock). The FDA is expected to okay a fast-growing salmon in the near future. And possibly on the horizon: pigs designed to produce omega-3s.

Yet because GM foods are not required to be labeled as such, it's impossible for consumers to tell them apart from regular foods. Gary Hirshberg, chairman and cofounder of Stonyfield, the organic yogurt company, thinks that's not right. Last October he partnered with Just Label It, a national coalition of nearly 450 organizations that's currently petitioning the FDA to give consumers a choice. More than 600,000 people have already signed. (To add your name, go to justlabelit.org.)

""The status quo is innocent until proven guilty,"" says Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian who studies GM foods, ""as it was for trans fats, DDT, and countless other harmful chemicals. A labeling requirement would motivate seed companies to prove to consumers that their products are safe, to protect their sales."" Nearly 50 other countries—including China, Brazil, and most European nations—have mandated that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) be marked, and in an MSNBC online poll, 96 percent of more than 45,000 respondents said that they should be labeled. At press time, 18 states had introduced legislation to promote GMO labeling.

Hirshberg, for one, remains impatient. ""I'm 57,"" he says. ""I don't want to wait another 30 years to see what the science says. At this point, I want to decide for myself."" "
Climate change is not a hoax — ask any millennial seeing it firsthand,2577,agree,"The basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple.

The story began nearly 150 years ago when Irish physicist John Tyndall discovered ‘carbonic acid’ – today known as carbon dioxide – was one of a number of “perfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours” to absorb radiant heat.

He also realised just how important this was to life on Earth as without such gases it would be “held fast in the iron grip of frost”.

About 40 years later, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up, particularly in the Arctic. But the idea remained mostly an academic question until, as he predicted, the mercury started to rise.

This is one of the certainties in climate science – the world has got warmer.

How do we know that the world has really warmed up?

Last year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, according to Nasa and the Met Office, boosted slightly by the natural El Nino effect. Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990.

In addition to thermometer records going back to the 1880s, there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glaciers retreating and sea ice melting to record lows, sea levels rising by 20cm, islands disappearing, animals and plants shifting their ranges and spring coming several weeks earlier.

Ironically, the famously impassable Northwest Passage – which claimed the lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to China – is now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming.

It is also certain that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that human activity is responsible for this. Helpfully, atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from fossil fuels has a different isotope signature to the gas produced naturally.

As Nasa puts it: “There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.”

How do we know that warming has anything to do with humans?

All this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming.

But the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument. It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment.

Outside of conspiracy theorists, cranks and some of the ruling US politicians, no one disputes the above is true. Even the UK’s leading ‘sceptic’ think tank, Nigel Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), agrees.

What will happen in the future?

Some commentators, including the GWPF, adopt a so-called ‘lukewarmist’ position, arguing that climate change will not be too bad so there is no need to stop using fossil fuels. They point to beneficial effects such as 'global greening' in which plant growth is boosted by the extra carbon in the air.

Others have claimed humanity is plunging headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which a tiny band of survivors cluster around the last remaining habitable territory near the poles.

Both groups are at odds with the science.

As Professor Tim Palmer, an Oxford University physicist who has worked on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), explained in a recent talk at the Royal Society, the ‘scientific consensus’ on climate change is that it could be anything between those two extremes.

According to computer models, developed using mathematics, the laws of physics and the best available knowledge, the world could be on course for between about 1.5C and more than 5C of warming as a result of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far it has risen from about 280 parts per million – a level that had remained fairly constant from the end of the last Ice Age to the 1800s – to more than 400ppm today.

“When we talk about scientific consensus, I would say it’s basically about this [temperature] distribution, it’s not individual predictions,” Professor Palmer told the Royal Society.

But, according to the models, there is a much higher probability of going beyond 2C of warming, than staying below this point, often regarded as when climate change becomes particularly ‘dangerous’.

And, as Professor Palmer also pointed out, there is also “a non-negligible probability of 5C or more, which would be utterly catastrophic”.

Models are often the source of derision from climate ‘sceptics’ or ‘deniers’, but they have actually proved remarkably successful when measured against actual observations. Even Arrhenius’ prediction that the Arctic would warm more quickly has proved to be true."
Climate change is not a hoax — ask any millennial seeing it firsthand,2579,disagree,"One of the main lines of evidence used by the Obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesn’t exist in the real world, according to a new report by climate researchers.

Researchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites, weather balloons, weather stations and buoys and found the so-called “tropical hotspot” relied upon by the EPA to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant “simply does not exist in the real world.”

They found that once El Ninos are taken into account, “there is no ‘record setting’ warming to be concerned about.”

“These analysis results would appear to leave very, very little doubt but that EPA’s claim of a Tropical Hot Spot (THS), caused by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, simply does not exist in the real world,” reads the report by economist James Wallace, climatologist John Christy and meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo.

“Also critically important, even on an all-other-things-equal basis, this analysis failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 13 critically important temperature time series analyzed,” they wrote.

When EPA released its CO2 endangerment finding in 2009, it used three lines of evidence to bolster its argument that greenhouse gases threatened human health through global warming.
The crux of EPA’s argument rested on the existence of a “tropical hotspot” where global warming would be most apparent. That is, there should be enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere — the “fingerprint” of global warming.

EPA’s endangerment finding is the legal basis for agency global warming regulations, including the Clean Power Plan (CPP) now being fought over in federal court. CPP aims to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent by 2030 and could cost $41 billion a year, according to independent estimates.

D’Aleo and his colleagues looked at the data and controlled for El Ninos and La Ninas. What they found was that once natural oceanic warming and cooling events are accounted for, there’s no warming trend.

“El Nino is not by any means new,” D’Aleo told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “The El Ninos and La Ninas do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster as we showed in our paper.”

Tropospheric temperatures are mainly measured by satellites and weather balloons, which collect data from the lowest few miles of the atmosphere. Satellites already show only slight warming since 1979, but they are sensitive to El Ninos and La Ninas.

Removing El Ninos and La Ninas from tropospheric temperatures creates “temperature time series each having a flat trend.” Basically, D’Aleo and his colleagues found oceanic warming events are responsible for virtually all the warming since 1977 when El Ninos became more frequent and stronger.

On the flip side, the recent “hiatus” in global warming can be explained by more frequent La Ninas, according to D’Aleo.

“It is an accepted fact that El Ninos bring global warmth and La Ninas cooling,” D’Aleo said. “It is thus not at all surprising that the period from 1947 to 1977 brought cooling, 1977 to 1997 warming and we had a flat trend from 1997 to current.”

With El Ninos and La Ninas adjusted out of the data, only volcanoes are left — base on EPA assumptions — to impact the climate, and D’Aleo’s report acknowledges “it was still possible that the volcanic activity was hiding CO2’s impact.”

Volcanic aerosols can have a cooling effect on global average temperature; the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo caused a dip in satellite temperature data that lasted for a couple years.

“The temperature data measurements that were analyzed were taken by many different entities using balloons, satellites, buoys and various land based techniques,” reads the report. “Needless to say, if regardless of data source, the results are the same, the analysis findings should be considered highly credible.”

Climate scientists have been debating for years over the existence of the “tropical hotspot.”

Christy, who co-runs the premier satellite temperature dataset at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with climatologist Roy Spencer, has presented evidence that climate models overpredicted warming in the tropical troposphere.

Ross McKitrick, an environmental economist at the University of Guelph in Canada, also ran the numbers and found climate models overestimated warming in the tropical troposphere.

McKitrick provided evidence of a phase shift in 1977 from dominant El Ninas to El Ninos — just like D’Aleo, Christy and Williams found.

“Over the 55-years from 1958 to 2012, climate models not only significantly over-predict observed warming in the tropical troposphere, but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than is observed,” McKitrick wrote in a 2014 study."
Climate change is not a hoax — ask any millennial seeing it firsthand,2580,disagree,"Climate change is the biggest scam in the history of the world – a $1.5 trillion-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer, every cent, penny and centime of which ends in the pockets of the wrong kind of people, none of which goes towards a cause remotely worth funding, all of it a complete and utter waste.

Nowhere is this truer in the field of the environment which, I sincerely believe – and I’ve been doing a lot of research into this – must count among the biggest wastes of tax money in the history of the world.

Last year Climate Change Business Journal – calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is $1.5 trillion a year.

All those carbon traders, climate researchers, renewables and biofuels experts, environment correspondents, professors of climate science at the University of East Anglia and the Potsdam Institute, sustainability officers on local councils, and so on, add up the cost of their grants and salaries – and $1.5 trillion per year is the ballpark figure you reach.

So what does $1.5 trillion look like in a global economic context?

Well, it’s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry.

$1.5 trillion on the global warming industry; $1.5 trillion on the online shopping industry.

But there’s a key difference between these two industries.

One exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want – to their mutual benefit; the other is a sham.

Buying stuff on the internet: it’s really useful, isn’t it? It has had a dramatically transforming effect on our quality of life, the way you can order a book at 11 o’clock on a Sunday night and have it appear on your doorstep the very next day.

But how did this marvellous industry spring up? Was it because of all the special incentives and tax breaks granted by wise governments? Nope of course not. They weren’t necessary. The online shopping industry sprung up and grew and grew because it was what people wanted, where they chose – of their own volition – to spend their money.

Now compare and contrast the global warming industry – which I call a Potemkin industry – because that’s what it is: a fraud; a sham; a conspiracy against the taxpayer.

Do you want to have a guess how much that industry would be worth if it weren’t for all the money funnelled into it via government grants and taxpayer levies and subsidies and regulatory capture?

Pretty close to zero, I’d say. Take wind farms – my hobby horse. The cost of intermittent, unreliable wind energy is roughly twice the market rate for onshore wind; three times the market rate for onshore. Nobody’s going to pay that kind of money in the open market. The only way it’s going to happen if people are mandated by the government to do so: which is what of course has happened across Europe and in the US.

Warren Buffett has said it: “wind farms don’t make sense without the tax credit.”

They’re inefficient; they kill birds and bats; they spoil views; they’re environmentally unfriendly – rare earth minerals from China; they’re hazardous; they’re expensive; they’re ugly (well I think they are….)

And in few countries is the damage these monstrosities have done more obvious than in Germany, home of the hateful Energiewende.

Energiewende means Energy Transition. It has been a disaster, as Rupert Darwall noted in a recent Telegraph article.

In 2004, the Green energy minister, Jürgen Trittin, claimed that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bills was equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream. Nine years later, CDU minister Peter Altmaier said Energiewende could cost around €1 trillion by the end of the 2030s. The cost of feed-in tariffs and other subsidies is currently €21.8bn a year; €20bn is being spent on a new north-south high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure is likely to double that number.

They cause real people real misery.

In 2013, 345,000 German households could not pay their electricity bills because Energiewende had made them so expensive.

That’s the financial damage they’ve caused. What about the environmental damage? Here we are in Germany, the Greenest nation on earth. Aren’t Greens supposed to care about animals? Well they don’t about bats, clearly.

Bats are special. The reason they’re so heavily protected by so many laws is that they are a K-selected species. That is, they reproduce very slowly, live a long time and are easy to wipe out. Having evolved with few predators – flying at night helps – bats did very well with this strategy until the modern world.

But now we have all those eco-friendly wind turbines. Or as I call them bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes. A recent study in Germany by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research showed that bats killed by German turbines may have come from places 1000 or more miles away. This would suggest that German turbines – which one study claims kill more than 200,000 bats a year – may be depressing populations across the entire northeastern portion of Europe.

Why would anyone put up such things. One reason and one reason only: follow the money.

Where does the money come from? Us!

Who made the decision to spend that money? Not us.

Oh definitely not us. Had it been us we might have done a bit of basic due diligence.

Like, OK, so these wind turbines are necessary you say to save the planet from the threat of catastrophic and unprecedented man-made global warming?

Correct.

So has the planet ever been as warm in human history as it is today?

Well, only in the Minoan warming period and the Roman warming period and the Medieval warming period.

Just those. Right. And presumably back then all that CO2 heavy industry was burning was a real problem? No just kidding…Out of interest how much has the planet warmed in the last few years?

About 0.8 degrees C since 1850.

Right so since the end of the Little Ice Age (so called because it was characterised by unpleasant cold) and years like the infamous Year Without A Summer (1816), the planet has heated by less than the temperature increase you’d get on a spring day between say breakfast and mid-morning coffee time?

Ah yes but the computer models…

Indeed the computer models. Those amazing models which have been predicting catastrophic, runaway warming, when there has been no significant warming since 1998 – so for eighteen years there has been no global warming?

Ah yes but the temperatures of February 2016….

Look I could go on like this forever. I’ve been listening to these increasingly desperate excuses for decades. Perhaps some of you here believe them – if so, there’s a bridge I’d like to sell you…

But it really doesn’t matter whether you believe in global warming or not because here’s the reality:

All that money we’re being to spend on the global warming industry – that $1.5 trillion I mentioned earlier siphoned straight out of taxpayers’ pockets – it isn’t going to make the blindest bit of difference.

No, I exaggerate. It will make a teeny weeny bit of difference. Bjorn Lomborg has done the calculations. You’re going to love this, if you haven’t heard this before. These figures are just amazing.

So recently you’ll recall there was a big UN climate conference in Paris COP 21 and all the leaders of the world flew in to save the planet from global warming. But before they turned up, each delegate nation made a voluntary agreement as to how much it was going to cut its carbon emissions. Not compulsory, note. So these countries are free at any stage to abandon their carbon reduction targets – as funnily enough South Korea did last week. This is how much – best case scenario – that various countries are prepared to do to combat climate change.

So Lomborg added up all the countries INDCs – that stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions – and worked out, using the climate alarmists’ own models, what effect all this would have on global temperature.

Do you want to know how much? (Oh this is the optimistic scenario by the way, not the pessimistic one).

If all the countries do their bit then the total reduction in global warming – by the year 2100 will be 0.170 degrees Centigrade.

As a climate sceptic friend of mine pointed out at the time, you’d experience a bigger temperature increase than that just walking down from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel tower.

So there’s your deal folks: you – and taxpayers like you – are paying $1.5 trillion a year to reduce the world’s temperatures by the end of this century by 0.170.

It’s so perfectly ridiculous it’s almost funny.

And I suppose on a personal level I shouldn’t complain. I call climate change “the gift that goes on giving” because day in day out I get an endless stream of stories to write about the corruption, incompetence, skullduggery of the climate alarmism industry.

But, putting my career aside for the moment, is this really a world we’d like to live in? Can it be right that people who have worked hard for their money should have it taken from them and then wasted in so spectacular fashion?

And it’s not just the waste that’s so bad it’s worse than that.

If it were simply a form of taxpayer-funded welfare scheme for otherwise unemployable environmental sciences graduates that would be one thing.

But this is causing real, lasting harm in any number of ways.

The corrupting effects on science – and the scientific method – which at times are almost redolent of Lysenkoism of the Stalin era.

The brainwashing of schoolchildren such as you might have found with the Young Pioneers.

The economic damage caused by the misallocation of resources, as so frequently happens in Communist countries

The pollution caused by diesel (introduced, on EU recommendation, because it’s supposedly more CO2-friendly) which calls to mind Chernobyl or the poisoning of the Aral Sea.

The human suffering of those 345,000 German households I mentioned who can’t pay their electricity bills.

Does this authoritarianism and corruption and incompetence remind you of anything?

Well it has often been said – and there is much anecdotal evidence to support this – that after the Berlin Wall came down the left had a bit of a problem. Capitalism had won the economic argument. Where could the left go next?

But the solution was there waiting them – the green movement. In the guise of saving the world’s environment they could advance all their usual obsessions – control, regulation, state intervention, puritanism, compulsory immiseration – though this time with a smiling, fluffy face. Watermelons they call them: green on the outside, red on the inside.

So the Berlin Wall came down but it never really went away.

And sometimes I look at the world and what has been happening with the rise and rise of green lunacy and I ask myself: did the right side really win the Cold War or is it just an illusion?"

"The ‘Fingerprint’ Of Global Warming Doesn’t Exist In The Real World, Study Finds
",2576,disagree,"In January, a group of Cornell University undergraduates travelled to the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, a region of the world considered to be one of the most vulnerable to climate change. There they met with farmers, climate experts, government officials and their peers and learned about the ominous changes taking place in the Mekong that, ultimately, will impact us all.

The trip was part of course intended to help millennials better appreciate the interconnected and interdependent world they live in and to fully grasp what is ahead for Vietnam and for them – a grand challenge, on a grand scale. About the time these students turn 50, sea-level rise will have displaced an estimated million residents of the Mekong Delta.


By 2100 much of the region will likely be underwater, affecting millions more. To say nothing about the impacts on major American cities, including Miami Beach, Boston and New York that, like the Mekong, have considerable real estate at risk from rising sea levels.


Changes caused by rising sea levels are already flooding into the Mekong Delta, especially in the rural areas where Vietnam grows much of its food. Our group of Cornell students learned that rains now fall during what was once the dry season, interfering with seed set and reducing rice yields.

Increasing salt-water intrusion is forcing farmers to abandon rice altogether and switch to more salt-tolerant options such as shrimp production and crops such as coconut and watermelons. More groundwater is being used to dilute salty water for irrigation and drinking, which in turn results in land subsidence and exacerbated saltwater intrusion.

From this two-week journey to a country 8,000 miles from home and at the forefront of our greatest global challenge, the students gathered stories to tell and share with the world – because what is happening in Vietnam will be repeated globally.

One of the first things the students learned was that climate change is accepted as fact in Vietnam; it is not politicized, and is discussed freely. Messages to take home, “The Vietnamese people do not avoid talking about the changing climate; it’s happening in their own backyard,” said Conor McCabe, an animal science major, class of ‘18. “Climate change is definitely an uncomfortable topic since it has so many ramifications for society and the livelihoods of everyday people. Taking part in that difficult discussion, rather than shying away, is what I plan to do from now on,” said Becky Cardinali, an economics major, class of ’19.

These millennials also learned that despite the history of the Vietnam War and the role the U.S. now plays in exacerbating climate change, the Vietnamese people were extraordinarily welcoming: “I felt so embarrassed that I had contributed to the climate change that was destroying their livelihoods. How did they repay me?  By inviting me into their homes for tea. They did not hate us, in fact they were extremely welcoming, hopeful and forward looking,” said Marc Alessi an up-and-coming meteorologist, class of ‘18.

One of the more salient moments during their visit occurred when students heard a Vietnamese government official explain that the evidence for climate change and its cause is well established, and for them, it is not a hoax. As the students observed, climate change is not a hoax for the rest of the world, nor is it a distant, future threat: “My time in the Mekong Delta served as a reminder that, for many, climate change is immediate,” said Gail Fletcher, majoring in history and government, class of ’17.

In 2016 the United States and Vietnam, along with nearly every other country on the planet, signed the Paris Agreement on climate change committing them all to a goal of keeping temperature rise to below 20C, maybe 1.5. Eerily, the Peace Accords that ended the longest war in American history were also signed in Paris. A war that cost the lives of 58,000 U.S. troops, many the same age as today’s Cornell students.

“Setting all other issues aside, the Paris Agreement must be backed by all signatories. The bond that can heal troubled relationships between countries can be a shared concern for the future of this planet.

Otherwise, as Earth continues to warm and food becomes more scarce, driving up prices, tensions among countries are only going to rise and result in more conflict, more wars. Regardless of your personal, religious or cultural beliefs, the Earth is going to keep on warming. And it is already happening in real life and is impacting real people. Ladies and gentlemen, it is 2017: time to wake up,” added Jeff Fralick, environmental science and sustainability major, class of ’18.

Climate change is not a hoax to these millennials, members of one of the largest voter-eligible blocks in the U.S. — nearly 1 in 3. It is deadly serious and an issue that just might arouse this sleeping giant. It is their future and yours."

A Sign That Obamacare Exchanges Are Failing,2583,discuss,"Did Obamacare work?

It’s worth reflecting upon after President Trump and House Republicans failed on Friday to repeal and replace the “disaster” of Obamacare.

Ever since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate. But by looking at the many ways the law has changed health care, it’s possible to hazard some judgments.

The answer may vary with your own experience, but it ultimately depends on what you value. For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to bring health insurance to more Americans, the rational answer should be: Yes, Obamacare succeeded. More than 20 million Americans gained health coverage through the law.

Continue reading the main story
For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to make health insurance affordable to all who want it, the rational answer is: No, Obamacare did not achieve uniform affordability. Health care in the United States remains the most expensive in the world, and coverage remains out of the financial reach of many Americans.

For those who believe the primary goal of the law was to make Americans healthier, the answer has to be: It is too soon to tell.

One thing is clear, though — the Affordable Care Act has shifted the nation’s baseline expectations for how health care should work. Its successes have pushed Republican politicians, like Mr. Trump, into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all Americans. Its failures have become focal points, too, leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals.

Since Republicans took power, public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor. For lots of people, “Obamacare” has become synonymous with the health care system itself, with its many miracles and dysfunctions.

There are layers beneath each judgment, of course. The law was broad and complex, with many goals and provisions. This assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments. For many important questions, there is not yet strong evidence either way.

Successes:

Twenty million more people have health insurance.

Providing health coverage to the uninsured was Obamacare’s principal goal, and on that measure, it has succeeded. The gain of 20 million insured, based on an Obama administration estimate last year, is probably now even higher.

Not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an “individual mandate” to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.

The rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform. In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldn’t get health care. Now, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C.B.O. analysis disagreed.

It has made many Americans more financially secure.

Health insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured. It is still early to measure the health law’s full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks. Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined.
It has reduced inequality.

In an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law. Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners. This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administration’s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans.

It made health insurance more comprehensive.

Before Obamacare, many products could be called “health insurance.” Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they can’t cap how much they will pay in a given year. Many of the law’s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patients’ access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings.

It lowered the federal deficit.

Obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost. A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025. (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the law’s tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference.)

Failures:

Health insurance remains very expensive.

Obamacare’s marketplaces and Medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line, but those earning not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premiums, and face deductibles that are much higher than those seen in a typical employer health plan. In the law’s first three years, premiums were lower than expected and grew slowly. But prices shot up this year, causing financial shocks for buyers who don’t receive government help in paying their premiums. Several analysts believe the increases resulted from recent policy changes and too-low early pricing and may represent a one-time market correction. Insurers have also said that they have found the pool of Obamacare enrollees to be sicker and less predictable in their health care needs than expected. Some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable.

The health care system remains complex and confusing.

President Barack Obama has described the health law’s markets as being like a Kayak or an Amazon for health insurance. They’re not. Health insurance is easier to shop for now, but it remains a complicated and opaque product, and selecting the right health plan is often frustrating or impossible for Americans unsure of their health needs — or unable to decode jargon like “out-of-pocket maximum” or “in-network provider.” After picking their insurance, patients can still struggle to use it, and can get stuck with surprise bills or long negotiations with their insurance companies.

In many parts of the country, only one insurer even offers health plans, limiting the choices available to consumers.

If you like your plan, you can’t always keep your plan. ...

The Obamacare marketplaces are set up to encourage customers to frequently switch their health plans to avoid steep price increases. The markets have also been turbulent, with insurers going out of business, exiting markets or shifting around their offerings each year. That has led to a large fraction of renewing customers who change health plans every year, unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it.

… Or your doctor.

Many Obamacare health plans, trying to keep prices competitive, have sharply limited the number of doctors or hospitals they will cover. Obamacare’s authors did not expect so-called narrow network plans to become so widespread. These have made it hard for some customers to find any plan that includes their favored providers, and means that switching plans often means switching doctors, too. The narrower networks, despite their inconveniences, have helped keep insurance prices lower.

Too Soon to Tell:

We don’t know if the law made America healthier.

Health insurance is not the same thing as health, and we still have very limited data about whether the law’s coverage expansion has lengthened lives or improved their quality in meaningful ways. There is some encouraging but very early evidence that low-income people in two states that expanded Medicaid reported improving overall health compared with their low-income neighbors in a state that did not. And there is research that more low-income Americans have visited a doctor and have received some basic preventive health services, including prescription contraceptives and treatments for diabetes.

But it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health, or how large that effect may be. Even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage, that’s a small fraction of the nation’s population, and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits.

It’s unclear what the law has done to national health spending.

A crucial goal for Mr. Obama was “bending the cost curve” and slowing the accelerating cost of health care in the United States. Growth in health spending has indeed slowed in the years since Obamacare’s passage, but it is hard to untangle the effects of the health law from other forces affecting health spending, including the Great Recession, rising insurance deductibles and a slowdown in the development of new medical technologies. The health law’s most ardent champions, including Mr. Obama, credit it for this change. But many economists are uncertain whether the slowdown is a result of the law or a mere coincidence.

It may have improved the quality of care in hospitals.

The health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidence-based. The health system is still often a dangerous place for patients, but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital, for example, or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks. Some trends were underway before the health law passed, so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by Obamacare or would have happened anyway."
CBO’s Alternate Facts Show Obamacare is Unsustainable,2582,disagree,"Congressional Republicans, evidently hoping that by repeating an untruth they’ll convince American voters, and perhaps themselves, that it’s a truth, on Wednesday said the Affordable Care Act has “failed.”

The undistilled version of this view came from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who emerged Wednesday from a meeting with Vice President-elect Mike Pence to assert: “This law has failed. Americans are struggling. The law is failing while we speak. … Things are only getting worse under Obamacare. … The healthcare system has been ruined — dismantled — under Obamacare.”

Every one of those statements is demonstrably untrue. How do we know this? We know because every measure of healthcare spending, access and cost has improved since the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Timothy McBride of Washington University in St. Louis has done the heavy lifting of pulling together the relevant charts and graphs, and posting them online in a series of 12 tweets compiled on Storify. We’ve culled some of the most important, and present them here.

We should add, first, that Ryan also pledged, once the GOP repeals the law, to “make sure that there is a stable transition to a truly patient-centered system. We want every American to have access to quality, affordable health coverage”

This is nothing but fatuous gobbledygook. The GOP has had six years to come up with an alternative plan, and never has done so. Its current strategy is to repeal the Affordable Care Act now, and then cook up a replacement sometime in the next two, three, even four years. (They can’t even agree on a time frame.) What exactly is a “patient-centered system,” anyway?

Here are the charts, courtesy of professor McBride.

First, the overall uninsured rate has come sharply down since the advent of Obamacare:
The uninsured rate for non-elderly adults fell from nearly 16% in 2010 to less than 10%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's now at a historic low.
The decline in uninsured rates was especially pronounced among lower-income Americans, according to the Council of Economic Advisors and other sources:

Uninsured rates fell by more than 10 percentage points among the poorest Americans eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act — those earning less than 138% of the federal poverty line.
Although Republicans claim that even if the Affordable Care Act brought down the uninsured rate, its enrollees had trouble seeing a doctor, that isn’t true. Numerous studies debunk claims that doctors shun Affordable Care Act enrollees. This sample by the Council of Economic Advisors shows that the decline in the uninsured rate is closely associated with a reduction in people who were prevented from seeking and finding medical care because of its cost:

Hospitals are major beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act, as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Council of Economic Advisors report. Hospitals’ uncompensated care costs fell sharply in Medicaid expansion states, as patients treated as indigent in the past are now covered by Medicaid. Their uncompensated care costs fell from an average 4% of operating costs before the Affordable Care Act to less than 2% afterward, a decline worth tens of billions of dollars nationwide.

Overall national health spending has come down even faster than was predicted, as a share of gross domestic product:


The average growth in per-enrollee spending by private health plans in key categories has slowed materially since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, from annual growth averaging 5% in 2000-2010, to 1.5% in 2010-2015. Spending growth on hospital services, physician services and prescription drugs all slowed. Medicare, which has instituted numerous cost-control initiatives under the Affordable Care Act, has seen an overall decline in spending per enrollee.

Finally, even though employer-based insurance hasn’t yet been directly affected by the Affordable Care Act, there seems to be a spillover effect from the overall reduction in healthcare spending growth. Premiums rose by an average 5.6% a year in the 10 years prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act, but only 3.1% since, according to Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual survey of employer health benefits.


Republicans have promised to give Americans a health insurance system better than the Affordable Care Act’s and at lower cost. This is almost surely a chimera; no plan that the GOP has considered would expand coverage beyond the Affordable Care Act. To the extent that the plans would reduce costs, they would do so by relieving the federal government of responsibility for paying for coverage and placing it even more heavily on the shoulders of individuals and families. That’s not lowering costs; it’s just shifting them to those least able to pay. The fact that the GOP will have to face is that bringing healthcare to more Americans costs money. Taking it away from millions of Americans will cost money, too.

No one claimed, either before the passage of the Affordable Care Act or afterward, that it was perfect or that it would solve America’s healthcare crisis in one swipe. What became evident in the three years since the individual insurance exchanges opened for business (on Jan. 1, 2014) is that the subsidies for premiums needed to be increased and improved. Because they’re inadequate, especially as households cross the threshold of 400% of the federal poverty line at which subsidies are eliminated — at about $97,200 for a family of four — middle-class families in the individual insurance market feel overburdened. They blame Obamacare for this injustice. The real culprits are Republicans who have refused to consider any approach to the Affordable Care Act except repeal. Now the GOP is “it” on healthcare, and it’s discovering that crafting a solution from scratch may be almost impossible.

What became evident during the most recent open-enrollment period for Obamacare exchanges is that “Obamacare is more popular than ever,” as Kevin Drum of Mother Jones observes. Enrollment grew to 12 million, up by about 1 million from 2015, even in the face of higher premiums. In any case, more than 85% of all enrollees are entitled to subsidies, which limits and in some cases cancels out the higher prices.

Yet the GOP pledges to overturn all that. The question the party never has found an answer to is: If this is what a failure looks like, how would it define a success?"
The success of the Affordable Care Act is a hugely inconvenient truth for its opponents,2581,disagree,"Yet more bad news for Obamacare this week: Molina Healthcare lost $110 million on the exchanges last year, and the CEO told investors, “There are simply too many unknowns with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017.”

At first glance, it’s hard to see why this piece of news is worth worrying about. UnitedHealth recently projected several times those losses, and it's a bigger player on the exchanges. Why spend so much time looking at one modest-size insurer?

Because Molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed to, by virtually every health-care-policy wonk in the business, as one of the “bright spots” on the exchanges. Molina is a company that specializes in covering poor people. Before Obamacare, they were a sizable player in the “Medicaid managed care” model, and it seemed like the expertise they’d thusly acquired was allowing them to design the sort of plans that actually made money on the exchanges. Which is to say bare bones plans, not fancy but adequate. Apparently, that’s no longer a money-maker, at least for Molina.

This isn’t necessarily the pattern we’ve seen with other insurers. Molina seems to have made money until it was forced to pay into a fund designed to transfer money from insurers that ended up with an unusually healthy patient pool, to those who got stuck with the sicker patients. Those losses were partially offset by lower medical costs than they expected, which is certainly good news. But it’s not great news. Lower-than-expected costs can be from the system working well, or they can simply come from the fact that you happened to get a healthier insurance pool. If the government makes you give the latter gains back, and more, then you’re still not going to be profitable. And insurers that aren’t profitable over the long term aren’t going to stick around.
Nor can you fix the problem by adjusting the transfer fund. Those losses are occurring somewhere in the market; someone has to pay for the care. If you got rid of Obamacare’s risk transfer provisions, those insurers would lose more money, and exit the market, and the patients would end up with some other insurer. Who would then lose a bunch of money on them. Unless the insurance market is profitable in aggregate, the exchanges are not going to stabilize.

Molina’s losses suggest that instead of stabilizing, the exchanges are getting worse. There is no way to fix Obamacare without fixing the pool so that younger, healthier people buy insurance.

Democrats had six years to come up with a way to do that (or perhaps I should say, a way to do that that could actually get through Congress without hordes of angry voters burning their representatives in effigy). They failed. Now Republicans are taking their shot, and so far at least, they don’t seem any more on target than Democrats were.

The life expectancy of the individual market for health insurance is not looking good."
The success of the Affordable Care Act is a hugely inconvenient truth for its opponents,2584,disagree,"Millions may lose coverage next year if Congress does not repeal Obamacare. That’s not what this week’s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis says, but it is reality. CBO’s estimating models seem impervious to reality. In the real world, the Obamacare exchanges are in crisis, millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid IRS penalties, and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements. But for CBO, Obamacare is a sea of tranquility. The agency assumes that only 26 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured this year and next if Obamacare is left in place. To hit that mark, 2 million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last. That seems unlikely. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates that 27.9 million people under age 65 lacked coverage as of September 30 last year, the most recent date for which government survey data are available. That represents little improvement over its estimate of 28.4 million as of December 2015, meaning that the number of non-elderly uninsured declined by only half a million through the first nine months of last year. Since then, the Obamacare individual exchanges have begun to implode. Fewer people signed up during the open-enrollment period this year than last, due in part to premium hikes that averaged 25 percent. Other insurance companies didn’t bother raising prices; they fled the exchanges. By January, 1,000 counties were down to their last insurer. Five entire states have just a single company selling through the exchanges. A rational observer might worry that the exchanges were on the brink of doom. Not CBO. Its analysts believe that Obamacare is on the cusp of a miracle. The number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in 2018, according to CBO, even though millions could find themselves without an insurer in their exchanges. That improbably happy outcome would change, the agency says, if Congress were to enact its repeal bill. In that case, CBO warns, the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by 4 million. That includes 2 million Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO believes they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pays virtually all their medical expenses. Ditto for 1 million people in the exchanges and an additional million with job-based coverage. CBO believes that these 4 million people so detest being insured that they will drop out of the system immediately after Congress repeals the tax on the uninsured. That number will rise to 14 million next year, according to CBO. That includes 5 million who will abandon Medicaid, 2 million who will drop their employer-sponsored coverage, and 6 million who will leave the exchanges. These 14 million people will not, despite what you’ve read, “lose coverage.” For the most part, CBO says, they “will choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying penalties” [emphasis added]. The GOP bill not only retains existing subsidies and Medicaid expansion through 2019, it provides additional money to states to stabilize their failing Obamacare exchanges. But that spending, according to CBO, won’t halt the stampede to the Obamacare exits induced by repeal of the individual mandate. CBO’s illusions about the effectiveness of the mandate don’t square with reality. The evidence suggests that the mandate has done little to reduce the number of uninsured. The IRS reports that in 2015, 6.5 million paid the penalty, 12.7 million obtained an exemption, while 4.3 million simply ignored it. That’s 23.5 million people who have chosen to be uninsured despite the government’s threat of tax penalties. CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. Let’s do the math. NHIS estimates that 44.3 million non-elderly were uninsured in 2013, the year before Obamacare was fully implemented. If CBO is to be believed, the number of uninsured will increase by 14 million next year, joining another 23.5 million uninsured people who either paid the tax in the past or found a way to avoid it. That would mean that 85 percent of the uninsured (37.5 million out of 44.3 million) apparently would want nothing to do with Obamacare’s government-defined and subsidized benefits were Congress to repeal the individual mandate. If CBO is correct, the government will have spent $462 billion between 2014 and 2018 on subsidies and Medicaid expansions, only to end up reducing the number of nonelderly uninsured from 44.3 million to 41 million. It is also possible that CBO is wrong about the individual mandate. That seems intuitively obvious to people whose heads aren’t buried in CBO’s faulty models. Some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplementing the mortgage-interest deduction with a tax on the homeless. But does anyone believe that if a Republican Congress repealed that tax, homeowners would shred their mortgages and head to the grates? CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. They begin with rosy assumptions about the current law. In the face of considerable contrary evidence, they assume that insurers will continue to sell in the exchanges next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage. They appear to believe that higher coverage rates that have occurred since 2014 are more attributable to tax penalties than to subsidies, despite feckless IRS enforcement. And they assume that even if Congress keeps the tax credits and Medicaid expansion in place next year and spends additional money to stabilize insurance markets, 14 million more people will join the ranks of the uninsured. Congress should set policy based on reality, not on CBO’s speculations. Obamacare exchanges are falling apart, Medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace, and taxing the uninsured is both ineffective and politically unsustainable. The House and Senate should act now to stabilize those markets, repeal the law (including the individual mandate), and replace it with a system that puts doctors and patients in control of health-care decision-making.
